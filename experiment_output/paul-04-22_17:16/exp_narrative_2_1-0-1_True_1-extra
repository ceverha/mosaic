I was on a ship for a few weeks. How are you?
<===>

[Resentfully.] It serves you right. A fine thing--you leaving me alone
on this barge all that time!
Well it's not my name.
<===>

Even with the best intentions, I won’t tell you lies. No; it is
not absolutely certain. It is probable. And there is something else I

You may be one of these exceptions or your wife may be. In that case—I
will use an expression you used just now—in that case the result would
be the most frightful horrors.
I leave town for a month and you lose your mind.

Now you've got till four to settle your accounts or it will go hard
with you.
