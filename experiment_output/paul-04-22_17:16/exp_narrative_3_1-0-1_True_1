A:
	I can't believe you threw that ball over the fence. Now you're going to have to go into that dark, scary, spooky forest all by yourself!

B:
	Can I make Freddy do it? He likes scary movies.

A:
	Well, all that about this being a rendezvous, and a terminus
for the busy world--that's something you've heard the townsfolk here
saying. Yes--they're in the habit of saying that sort of thing.

B:
	What does "terminus" mean? We haven't learned that word in school yet.

A:
	Hurry up! You're making me worried. [hears scream] What was that? Hold on!

B:
	Wait, don't go in there! [chases]

A:
	There may be a slight tinge of calculation even in our highest
purposes. But the misfortune about you is that you can see nothing but
the calculation, though it may be only an infinitesimal part of the
whole thing.

B:
	Is everything okay? You're acting really weird...what is "infinitesimal?"

A:
	It hurts so much, make it stop!

B:
	[scared] I'm calling Dad!

A:
	Mad as a March hare. He did frighten me, I can tell you
just before you came in that time. Haven't you noticed the queer things
he says?

B:
	Yes, he's been talking really weird. Is he going to be alright?

A:
	Be quiet. 

B:
	[shocked silence]

A:
	Ha I ha! ha! I'm a funny one! don't you think? Ha! ha! Yes,
that's the way! (_She goes about laughing, and rocks back and forth.
She takes a little handkerchief, which she carries folded in triangular
form in her belt; and holds it under_ Auguste's _nose_) Smell it?

B:
	[nervously] It doesn't smell like anything.
