A:
	We are lost in this cave. How much more battery power do we have left?

B:
	It’s well that we should speak our minds out plainly,
  For when we die we shall be spoken of
  In many countries. We in our young days
  Have seen the heavens like a burning cloud
  Brooding upon the world, and being more
  Than men can be now that cloud’s lifted up,
  We should be the more truthful. Conchubar,
  I do not like your children—they have no pith,
  No marrow in their bones, and will lie soft
  Where you and I lie hard.

A:
	You rail at them
  Because you have no children of your own.

B:
	I think myself most lucky that I leave
  No pallid ghost or mockery of a man
  To drift and mutter in the corridors,
  Where I have laughed and sung.

A:
	That is not true,
  For all your boasting of the truth between us;
  For, there is no man having house and lands,
  That have been in the one family
  And called by the one name for centuries,
  But is made miserable if he know
  They are to pass into a stranger’s keeping,
  As yours will pass.

B:
	The most of men feel that,
  But you and I leave names upon the harp.

A:
	You play with arguments as lawyers do,
  And put no heart in them. I know your thoughts,
  For we have slept under the one cloak and drunk
  From the one wine cup. I know you to the bone.
  I have heard you cry, aye in your very sleep,
  ‘I have no son,’ and with such bitterness
  That I have gone upon my knees and prayed
  That it might be amended.

B:
	For you thought
  That I should be as biddable as others
  Had I their reason for it; but that’s not true,
  For I would need a weightier argument
  Than one that marred me in the copying,
  As I have that clean hawk out of the air
  That, as men say, begot this body of mine
  Upon a mortal woman.

A:
	Now as ever
  You mock at every reasonable hope,
  And would have nothing, or impossible things.
  What eye has ever looked upon the child
  Would satisfy a mind like that?

B:
	I would leave
  My house and name to none that would not face
  Even myself in battle.

A:
	Being swift of foot,
  And making light of every common chance,
  You should have overtaken on the hills
  Some daughter of the air, or on the shore
  A daughter of the Country-under-Wave.

B:
	I am not blasphemous.

A:
	Yet you despise
  Our queens, and would not call a child your own,
  If one of them had borne him.

B:
	I have not said it.

A:
	Ah! I remember I have heard you boast,
  When the ale was in your blood, that there was one
  In Scotland, where you had learnt the trade of war,
  That had a stone-pale cheek and red-brown hair.
  And that although you had loved other women,
  You’d sooner that fierce woman of the camp
  Bore you a son than any queen among them.

B:
	You call her a ‘fierce woman of the camp,’
  For having lived among the spinning-wheels,
  You’d have no woman near that would not say,
  ‘Ah! how wise!’ ‘What will you have for supper?’
  ‘What shall I wear that I may please you, sir?’
  And keep that humming through the day and night
  Forever. A fierce woman of the camp!
  But I am getting angry about nothing.
  You have never seen her. Ah! Conchubar, had you seen her
  With that high, laughing, turbulent head of hers
  Thrown backward, and the bow-string at her ear,
  Or sitting at the fire with those grave eyes
  Full of good counsel as it were with wine,
  Or when love ran through all the lineaments
  Of her wild body—although she had no child,
  None other had all beauty, queen, or lover,
  Or was so fitted to give birth to kings.
