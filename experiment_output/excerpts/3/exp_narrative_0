A:
	Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.

B:
	Has he come with you? (Caesar shakes his head: she is cruelly
disappointed.) Oh, I wish he had, I wish he had. If only I were a little
older; so that he might not think me a mere kitten, as you do! But
perhaps that is because YOU are old. He is many, MANY years younger than
you, is he not?

A:
	Would he be my husband, do you think, if I asked him?

B:
	Very likely.

A:
	But I should not like to ask him. Could you not persuade him
to ask me--without knowing that I wanted him to?

B:
	Why do you say that as if you were sorry for me? Does he love
anyone else?

A:
	I am afraid so.

B:
	Not quite the first. He is greatly admired by women.

A:
	I wish I could be the first. But if he loves me, I will make
him kill all the rest. Tell me: is he still beautiful? Do his strong
round arms shine in the sun like marble?

B:
	He is in excellent condition--considering how much he eats and
drinks.

A:
	Oh, you must not say common, earthly things about him; for I
love him. He is a god.

B:
	He is a great captain of horsemen, and swifter of foot than any
other Roman.

A:
	What is his real name?

B:
	Yes. I always call him Horus, because Horus is the most
beautiful of our gods. But I want to know his real name.

A:
	His name is Mark Antony.

B:
	No, my child; but your father, as you say, never worked. I
always work. So when he lost his crown he had to promise me 16,000
talents to get it back for him.
