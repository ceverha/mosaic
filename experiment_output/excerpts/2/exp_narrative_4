A:
	Let me get this straight. You did what?

B:
	Go ahead. Let me know about it and I'll give you a shove so you don't
miss it.

A:
	[_Screaming._] Do I have to stand for that, that I gotta drag in two
loads o' wood at night!

B:
	[_In mock astonishment._] Well, now, that's pretty awful, ain't it? You
gotta drag in wood? Such people, I tell you!

A:
	... An' I gets twenty crowns for the whole year. I'm to get my hands
frost-bitten for that, am I? An' not enough potatoes and herring to go
round!

B:
	MRS. WOLFF

A:
	You needn't go fussin' about that, you silly girl. Here's the key; go,
cut yourself some bread. An' when you've had enough, go your way,
y'understand? The plum butter's in the top cupboard.

B:
	[_Takes a large loaf of bread from a drawer and cuts some slices._] An'
Juste gets forty crowns a year from the Schulze's an'....

A:
	Don't you try to be goin' too fast.--You ain't goin' to stay with them
people always; you ain't hired out to 'em forever.--Leave 'em on the
first of April, for all I care.--But up to then, you sticks to your
place.--Now that you got your Christmas present in your pocket, you want
to run away, do you? That's no way. I have dealin's with them people, an'
I ain't goin' to have that kind o' thing held against me.

B:
	These bits o' rag that I got on here?

A:
	You're forgettin' the cash you got?

B:
	Yes! Six shillin's. That was a whole lot!

A:
	Cash is cash! You needn't kick.

B:
	But if I can go an' make more?

A:
	Yes, talkin'!

B:
	No, sewin'! I can go in to Berlin and sew cloaks. Emily Stechow's been
doin' that ever since New Year.
