We are lost in this cave. How much more battery power do we have left?

Do you think so? It seems to me that when a man and a woman have found
everything in each other, as we have, when they have been to each other

resolved to die fighting back to back, together to the last, as you
used to say it seems to me that in such a case there isn't much room
for expiation. If Purgatory is like that it must be fairly habitable.
