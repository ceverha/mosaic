A:
	Let me get this straight. You did what?

B:
	What does it all mean? I do not understand you. Tell me,
straight out!

A:
	A new summer has blossomed in my heart--my eyes have regained
the clearness of youth. And, accordingly, I am now standing where--

B:
	Where? Where are you standing?

A:
	Where your children are standing.

B:
	You? You! The thing is impossible! Where do you say you are
standing?

A:
	On the same side as Laurits and Hilda.

B:
	An apostate. John Rosmer an apostate.

A:
	What you are calling apostasy ought to have made me feel
sincerely happy and fortunate; but for all that I have suffered keenly,
because I knew quite well it would cause you bitter sorrow.

B:
	Rosmer, Rosmer, I shall never get over this. (Looks at him
sadly.) To think that you, too, could bring yourself to sympathise with
and join in the work of disorder and ruin that is playing havoc with
our unhappy country.

A:
	It is the work of emancipation that I sympathise with.

B:
	Oh yes, I know all about that. That is what it is called, by
both those who are leading the people astray and by their misguided
victims. But, be sure of this--you need expect no emancipation to be
the result of the spirit that relies on the poisoning of the whole of
our social life.

A:
	I do not give my allegiance to the spirit that is directing
this, nor to any of those who are leading the fight. I want to try to
bring men of all shades of opinion together--as many as I can
reach--and bind them as closely together as I can. I want to live for
and devote all the strength that is in me to one end only--to create a
real public opinion in the country.

B:
	So you do not consider that we have sufficient public opinion!
I, for my part, consider that the whole lot of us are on the high road
to be dragged down into the mire where otherwise only the common people
would be wallowing.

A:
	It is just for that reason that I have made up my mind as to
what should be the real task of public opinion.

B:
	What task?
