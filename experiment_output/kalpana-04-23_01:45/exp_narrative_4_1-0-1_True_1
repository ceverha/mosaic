B:
	I appreciate your cooperation while I'm going through this.

A:
	I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.

B:
	It's too hard to talk about.

A:
	Good-night, papa!

B:
	Thank you for understanding not wanting to talk.

A:
	Get out! GET OUT!

B:
	[shrinks away] You don't have to be so aggressive about it.

A:
	Of course I will!

B:
	What did I do to upset you?

A:
	I don't care. Don't speak to me again.

B:
	Well this took a turn for the worst.

B:
	I should leave now...
