A:
	I can't believe you threw that ball over the fence. Now you're going to have to go into that dark, scary, spooky forest all by yourself!

B:
	No way! You have to come with me!

A:
	[With some hesitation.] What I now feel so keenly--and so
painfully--that I require, is to have some one about me who really and
truly stands close to me--

B:
	That could be me if you come with me into the forest.

A:
	Hurry up! You're making me worried. [hears scream] What was that? Hold on!

B:
	[looks around] I didn't hear anything. I think you're making things up.

A:
	I!
What should make you think I have any influence of that kind with my
husband?

B:
	When did your husband come into this?

A:
	It hurts so much, make it stop!

B:
	I want to get out of this forest as much as you do.

A:
	Don't think about that, father; you have plenty of time before
you.--Hello, here are the boys already!

B:
	If you see someone in the forest, then we need to run!

A:
	Be quiet. 

B:
	I'm trying but there are so many leaves.

A:
	Big things done--? I do not understand--.

B:
	We haven't gotten the ball yet.
