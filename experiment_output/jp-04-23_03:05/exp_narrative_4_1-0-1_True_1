A:
	Let me get this straight. You did what?

B:
	I went over to the neighbors house and I decided that it was time they knew. They should know that you created a human machine in the living room.

A:
	 There was a physiology and hygiene class started at school;
but of course none of our girls were let attend it.

B:
	They shouldn't. If women started getting an education, they could take what we have.

A:
	I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.

B:
	What do you mean. It's only common sense, this is a man's world.

A:
	Then I shall have to educate myself for it; to train myself; to
discipline myself.

B:
	You shouldn't worry too much about it.

A:
	Get out! GET OUT!

B:
	This is my house.

A:
	Yet she breaks hearts, easy as her house is. That poor devil
upstairs with his flute howls when she twists his heart, just as Mangan
howls when my wife twists his.

B:
	Don't ever talk to me or my son again you crazy hag.

A:
	I don't care. Don't speak to me again.

B:
	Fine.

A:
	[_Merrily._] Well, this is a brand new household what's jus' had a child
born into it. I said to the boss: I'm a newly married man! Then he axed
me if my first wife was dead. On the contrary an' not a bit of it, I
says. She's alive an' kickin', so that she's jus' given birth to a
kickin' young citizen o' Berlin, that's what! When I was travellin' along
from Hamburg this mornin' by all the old stations--Hamburg, Stendal,
Ultzen--an' got outa the fourth-class coach at the Lehrter station with
all my duds, the devil take me if I didn't thank God with a sigh. I guess
he didn't hear on account o' the noise o' the trains.

B:
	Holy shit. I never knew you were this crazy. I knew you had issues with mental health and multiple personalities, but not to this degree.
