	I can't believe you threw that ball over the fence. Now you're going to have to go into that dark, scary, spooky forest all by yourself!

B:
	I dont' care, I'll do it.

A:
	No.

B:
	Okay fine, I can't do it.

A:
	Hurry up! You're making me worried. [hears scream] What was that? Hold on!

B:
	Nope.

A:
	The previous line could not be replied to.

B:
	Yeah right, get the fuck out of here.

A:
	It hurts so much, make it stop!

B:
	Sorry, I can't help you there.

A:
	Please tell me!

B:
	If I told you, Peter would know. He wouldn't let you go on the ferris wheel.

A:
	Be quiet. 

B:
	YOU'RE TELLING ME?

A:
	It is no longer any concern of yours; but when you have a son
you will be able to tell him what to do.

B:
	Don't let me forget my grandkids.
