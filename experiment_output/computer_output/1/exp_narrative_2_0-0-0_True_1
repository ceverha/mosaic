A:
	How are you doing today? I haven't seen you in a while.

B:
	You are an exceedingly clever lady-killer, Hector. And
terribly handsome. I am quite a good player, myself, at that game. Is it
quite understood that we are only playing?

A:
	How in the world could you think--!

B:
	You know, dear, that if any one sings _your_ praises, that is
enough to make me their friend at once. And when, to crown all, this man
did it who had behaved so unjustly to you,

A:
	Really? Now that's hard to believe. 

B:
	see in the mirror that you are a thief, a simple, common thief.
Just now, when you sat there in your shirt-sleeves, I noticed that
something was wrong about my book-shelf, but I couldn't make out what it
was,

A:
	You heard, Paul, that the young lady didn't come back no more. An' that
shows you, don't it ...

B:
	Oh, I found a way, Jette!

A:
	It's all about finding the balance.

B:
	Now you know, John.

A:
	Some decent lad, I suppose, with a good way of living and a mind to
send up his name upon the roads.

B:
	[In a scream.] Don't, Mat! For Gawd's sake! [Then raging and
pounding on the table with her hands.] Get out of here! Leave me alone!
Get out of here!

A:
	That is surprising - I never thought about it like that before.

B:
	You have to go and be a pillar of
society, brother-in-law.

A:
	But at least I shall not be bored. The service of the Life
Force has that advantage, at all events. So fare you well, Senor Satan.

B:
	I don’t want to see the world: I’ve seen enough of it.
