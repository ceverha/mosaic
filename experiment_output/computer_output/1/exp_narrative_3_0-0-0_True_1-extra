I can't believe you threw that ball over the fence. Now you're going to have to go into that dark, scary, spooky forest all by yourself!
<===>
You take care of me! You stay safe, and send me into every kind of
danger. You sent me down the cliff for gulls’ eggs while you warmed
your blind eyes in the sun; and then you ate all that were good for
food. You left me the eggs that were neither egg nor bird. [_BLIND MAN
tries to rise; FOOL makes him lie down again._] Keep quiet now, till
I shut the door. There is some noise outside—a high vexing noise,
so that I can’t be listening to myself. [_Shuts the big door._] Why
can’t they be quiet! why can’t they be quiet! [_BLIND MAN tries to get
away._] Ah! you would get away, would you! [_Follows BLIND MAN and
brings him back._] Lie there! lie there! No, you won’t get away! Lie
there till the kings come. I’ll tell them all about you. I will tell it
all. How you sit warming yourself, when you have made me light a fire
of sticks, while I sit blowing it with my mouth. Do you not always make
me take the windy side of the bush when it blows, and the rainy side
when it rains?

Oh, good Fool! listen to me. Think of the care I have taken of you. I
have brought you to many a warm hearth, where there was a good welcome
for you,
<===>
Oh, good Fool! listen to me. Think of the care I have taken of you. I
have brought you to many a warm hearth, where there was a good welcome
for you, but you would not stay there; you were always wandering about.

The last time you brought me in it was not I who wandered away, but
you that got put out because you took the crubeen out of the pot when
nobody was looking.
<===>
Most of it, I think. I had to go down for a moment when
Mortensgaard came.

Hurry up! You're making me worried. [hears scream] What was that? Hold on!
<===>
POPOV. Nothing. You may go. But--wait a moment. No, go on, go on. I
hate you. Or--no; don't go. Oh, if you knew how angry I was, how angry!
[_She throws the revolver on to the chair._] My finger is swollen from
this thing. [_She angrily tears her handkerchief._] What are you
standing there for? Get out!

Farewell!
<===>
Farewell and good luck to you!

Out upon you!  If you wish a huntsman good luck he will
never come within shot of the prey.

[_Starts_, _with a gesture of pain_.  _Then restrains
herself_, _and comes over to where_ LADY WINDERMERE _is sitting_.  _As
she speaks_, _she stretches out her hands towards her_, _but does not
dare to touch her_.]  Believe what you choose about me.  I am not worth a
moment’s sorrow.  But don’t spoil your beautiful young life on my
account!  You don’t know what may be in store for you, unless you leave
this house at once.  You don’t know what it is to fall into the pit, to
be despised, mocked, abandoned, sneered at—to be an outcast! to find the
door shut against one, to have to creep in by hideous byways, afraid
every moment lest the mask should be stripped from one’s face, and all
the while to hear the laughter, the horrible laughter of the world, a
thing more tragic than all the tears the world has ever shed.  You don’t
know what it is.  One pays for one’s sin, and then one pays again, and
all one’s life one pays.  You must never know that.—As for me, if
suffering be an expiation, then at this moment I have expiated all my
faults, whatever they have been; for to-night you have made a heart in
one who had it not, made it and broken it.—But let that pass.  I may have
wrecked my own life, but I will not let you wreck yours.  You—why, you
are a mere girl, you would be lost.  You haven’t got the kind of brains
that enables a woman to get back.  You have neither the wit nor the
courage.  You couldn’t stand dishonour!  No!  Go back, Lady Windermere,
to the husband who loves you, whom you love.  You have a child, Lady
Windermere.  Go back to that child who even now, in pain or in joy, may
be calling to you.  [LADY WINDERMERE _rises_.]  God gave you that child.
He will require from you that you make his life fine, that you watch over
him.  What answer will you make to God if his life is ruined through you?
Back to your house, Lady Windermere—your husband loves you!  He has never
swerved for a moment from the love he bears you.  But even if he had a
thousand loves, you must stay with your child.  If he was harsh to you,
you must stay with your child.  If he ill-treated you, you must stay with
your child.  If he abandoned you, your place is with your child.

It hurts so much, make it stop!
<===>
want to so much. If it won’t bore you. It would make me so
happy.

Go on.
<===>
Go on! go on!

It's true I never passed my examination; but I have read enough
law to know that----
<===>
You may be sure she did not fail to notice that we read the
same books; that we sought one another's company, and discussed every
new topic together. But I cannot understand it--because I was always so
careful to spare her. When I look back, it seems to me that I did
everything I could to keep her apart from our lives. Or did I not,
Rebecca?

Be quiet. 
<===>
Be quiet, down there!

He made me promise that, on the day on which his daughter was to
be presented at the palace as the King's betrothed, I would stand up
in some public place where she would pass by,
<===>
Wait till the full light of the day and you’ll see the burying he’ll
have. It is not in this place we will be waking him. I’ll make a call
to the two hundred Ribbons he was to lead on to the attack on the
barracks at Aughanish. They will bring him marching to his grave upon
the hill. He had surely some gift from the other world, I wouldn’t say
but he had power from the other side.

What way would there be a sign of life and the life gone out of him
this three hours or more?
<===>
Not yet. I must remain in her eyes, until the close of the day, the
pitiless tyrant whom she curses in her heart. My poor, dear child!...
How I have tortured your adorable love!... But I have already told
you the object of these proofs.... In making you suffer, I have but
been the instrument of fate and the unworthy slave of another will,
whose source I do not know, which seems to demand that the slightest
happiness should be surrounded by tears.... I have but hastened, in
order to bring happiness more quickly, the coming of those tears
which hung in suspense between your two destinies.... You shall know
some day by what power, a power which has no magical or supernatural
quality, but which still lies hidden at the bottom of men's lives,
I at times command certain phenomena, certain appearances that
bewildered you. You shall also learn that I have acquired the gift,
often a useless one, of reading the future a little more clearly and
a little further than the rest of men.... And so I saw you, groping
for each other, in time and space, for an unparalleled love, the
most perfect perhaps that the two or three centuries over which
my eyes have turned concealed within their shade.... You might
have met each other after many wanderings; but it was necessary to
hasten the expected meeting, because of you, my son, whom death
claimed in the absence of love.... And, on the other side, nothing
marked out Joyzelle for the hoped-for love, save a few scattered
and uncertain points and the proofs themselves which she was to
surmount. I therefore hurried on the prescribed proofs: they have
all been painful, but necessary; the last will be decisive and more
serious....
