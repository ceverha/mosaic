A:
	Let me get this straight. You did what?

B:
	[_Screaming._] Do I have to stand for that, that I gotta drag in two
loads o' wood at night!

A:
	Certainly, Mrs. Wolff, I can well believe that.

B:
	The strangest of all is that Lady Inger thinks the same----

A:
	I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.

B:
	In a few days, I guess. Don't be impatient. (Murray
_grunts and moves nervously on his chair._) What's the matter? Don't
you like us here at the Sanatorium?

A:
	[Turning over the papers.] Oh, I daresay Judge Brack will be so kind as
to look in now and then, even though I am out.

B:
	Would you mind if I went
with you?--for I do not know the way myself.

A:
	Get out! GET OUT!

B:
	And you won't drink any coffee, either! Now, now, don't

sang till the manufacturers' houses tumbled about their ears an' all the
superintendents' helmets danced on the top of their heads.

B:
	Night of the following day. A row of cells in the prison on
Blackwells Island. The cells extend back diagonally from right front to
left rear. They do not stop, but disappear in the dark background as if
they ran on,

A:
	I don't care. Don't speak to me again.

B:
	Not me. I don't want never to see him again, I don't. He's a
disgrace to me, he is, collecting dust, instead of working at his trade.

A:
	Yes, I'll admit that was my opinion--only I
wanted to be sure you'd found out for yourself.

B:
	[_indignantly_] Oh, hush! I tell you Annette is the victim of
this wretch. If you are going to do nothing but insult her, we had
better stop discussing the matter.
