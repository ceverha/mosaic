Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.
<===>
Well, I thought it should be the young wife of a sailor, who
lies sleeping in strange unrest, and she is dreaming. I fancy I shall do
it so that you will see she is dreaming.

Is there anything else?
<===>
Is there anything wrong?

No, no, not in the least. It is only something--it is my new
dress--
<===>
I will not.  You talk of atonement for a wrong done.
What atonement can be made to me?  There is no atonement possible.  I am
disgraced: he is not.  That is all.  It is the usual history of a man and
a woman as it usually happens, as it always happens.  And the ending is
the ordinary ending.  The woman suffers.  The man goes free.

I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.
<===>
Oh, you won't admit it, I know. But I call it the most decisive
victory of my life. I love Mrs. Falk--and she loves me.

If you were not in such an excited condition--
<===>
Mrs. Arbuthnot, I wish you would let us be friends.  You are so
different from the other women here.  When you came into the Drawing-room
this evening, somehow you brought with you a sense of what is good and
pure in life.  I had been foolish.  There are things that are right to
say, but that may be said at the wrong time and to the wrong people.

I heard what you said.  I agree with it, Miss Worsley.
<===>
If I was doing it proper, what was you laughing at? [To Higgins]
Have I said anything I oughtn't?

You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.
<===>
Always is a long word, Tavy. You see, I shall have to live up
always to your idea of my divinity; and I don't think I could do that if
we were married. But if I marry Jack, you'll never be disillusioned--at
least not until I grow too old.

I too shall grow old, Ann. And when I am eighty, one white
hair of the woman I love will make me tremble more than the thickest
gold tress from the most beautiful young head.
<===>
When winter sleep is abroad my hair grows thin,
    My feet unsteady. When the leaves awaken
    My mother carries me in her golden arms.
    I’ll soon put on my womanhood and marry
    The spirits of wood and water, but who can tell
    When I was born for the first time? I think
    I am much older than the eagle cock
    That blinks and blinks on Ballygawley Hill,
    And he is the oldest thing under the moon.

She is of the faery people.
<===>
I also am heaven-born and a maid, Amaotome. Of them there are many. This
is the dividing of my body, that is fruit of the moon's tree, Katsuma.
[4] This is one part of our dance that I leave to you here in your world.

With you dead, what keeps me alive?
<===>
What’s the good of my telling you? It’s all over. There’s
nothing left. He didn’t love me: he never loved me. He’s gone. He’s
going to marry another woman.

He’s _gone_?
<===>
She has gone away?

She loves the man you--? Good God, look at Hagbart!
<===>
What nonsense! I assure you, my dear Major, my dear
Madame, the gracious young lady simply saved my life, nothing
else. She never cared two straws for me. Why, bless my heart and
soul, look at the young lady and look at me. She, rich, young,
beautiful, with her imagination full of fairy princes and noble
natures and cavalry charges and goodness knows what! And I, a
common-place Swiss soldier who hardly knows what a decent life
is after fifteen years of barracks and battles--a vagabond--a
man who has spoiled all his chances in life through an incurably
romantic disposition--a man--
