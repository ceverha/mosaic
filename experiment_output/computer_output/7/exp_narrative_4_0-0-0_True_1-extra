Similarity pairs

Let me get this straight. You did what?
<===>
Yes, you see how much I need it. You must coach me up to the last
minute. Promise me that, Torvald!

You can depend on me.
<===>
You can go, if you like, and take our excuses.

That wouldn't do. Remember you are married now.
<===>
I did not. You never asked me. If we were married, you would
never dare treat me as you are doing now.

I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.
<===>
Because I am not going to translate it.

But you promised me faithfully.
<===>
Well, I will tell you, if you solemnly promise to tell
everybody else.

Thank you, thank you.  I will make a point of repeating
it.
<===>
canâ€™t give you my word. I can only repeat: I will think it
over.

Get out! GET OUT!
<===>
I want to get away from them!

Rest easy, little one--you do.
<===>
You look tired. You must rest a little!

(_Shakes his head_) If Herr Muhlingk, Junior, sends word, or
comes himself, call me. (_He goes off_)
<===>
[_Enters from hall. Takes a few steps, then stops and looks round,
scarcely believing his eyes; shakes his head, taps his forehead._] Who am
I? Weaver Anton Ansorge. Has he gone mad, Old Ansorge? My head's goin'
round like a humming-top, sure enough. What's he doin' here. He'll do
whatever he's a mind to. Where is Ansorge? [_He taps his forehead
repeatedly._] Something's wrong! I'm not answerable! I'm off my head! Off
with you, off with you, rioters that you are! Heads off, legs off, hands
off! If you takes my house, I takes your house. Forward, forward!

I don't care. Don't speak to me again.
<===>
I don't know whether I want to laugh or to cry.

Believe me, you are mistaken about this, Miss Valborg. You
don't see things as plainly as I do.
<===>
JUNO. I don't think we'll talk about it any more. Danger is all
very well when you do escape; but sometimes one doesn't. I tell you
frankly I don't feel as safe as you do--if you really do.

But surely you can do as you please without injuring anyone,
Mrs. Juno. That is the whole secret of your extraordinary charm for me.
<===>
[Peremptorily.] You are making a fool of yourself, Curt--and
you are damned insulting in the bargain. I think I may say that we've
all about reached the end of our patience. What Emily said is for your
own best interest, if you had the sense to see it. And I put it to you
once and for all: Are you or are you not willing to act like a man of
honor to protect your own good name, the family name, the name of this
child, and your wife's memory? Let me tell you, your wife's good name
is more endangered by your stubbornness than anything else.
