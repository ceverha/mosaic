We are lost in this cave. How much more battery power do we have left?
<===>
And you have no right to; no right to despise me! Lona, you
can have no idea how utterly alone I stand in this cramped and stunted
community--where I have had, year after year, to stifle my ambition for
a fuller life. My work may seem many-sided, but what have I really
accomplished? Odds and ends--scraps. They would not stand anything else
here. If I were to go a step in advance of the opinions and views that
are current at the moment, I should lose all my influence. Do you know
what we are--we who are looked upon as pillars of society? We are
nothing more, nor less, than the tools of society.

Why have you only begun to realise that now?
<===>
There, that will do, that will do, that will do.... You can well
believe, if I had been opposed to it on principle, I should have
long since put an end to the business, shouldn't I?... But there are
things--well, in short, that you don't understand. Well, I should not
have begun about the matter to-day, but necessity knows no law, eh? And
if I go to see him this evening, I don't wish to grope altogether in
the dark.... So--on the basis of what has just been said--have you,
perhaps, by any chance had a letter from him?

No, uncle!
<===>
No thank you, uncle, not now.

How much food do we have left? I'm beginning to worry.
<===>
Don't you understand, dear? I believe I could become of some
use in the office. And in that way, you know, we might begin afresh--and
try, with God's help, to pay your creditors.

Father, forgive me for all that
I have neglected to do! You shall see how I will try and make up for it!
How hard I shall work!
<===>
If you do not love Aagot, I must repeat that you have no right
to be here. You owe that much consideration both to her and to me.

I assure you that it is from nothing but the sincerest
consideration for you that I am here now.
<===>
I am sure I shouldn't have asked for any of it if you had grudged
it.

Look! Is that a shaft of light I see?
<===>
Do not cry out.... Do not cry out so.... Come, we will open the
shutters.... You cannot see here. Alladine!... She is already sitting
up. Alladine, come too.... Do you see, my children, it is dark in
the room. It is as dark here as if we were a thousand feet under the
ground. But I open one of the shutters, and behold! All the light of
the sky and the sun!... It does not need much effort; the light
is full of good-will.... It suffices that one call it; it always
obeys.... Have you seen the river with its little islands between the
meadows in flower?... The sky is a crystal ring to-day.... Alladine!
Palomides, come see.... Draw both of you near Paradise.... You must
kiss each other in the new light.... I bear you no ill-will. You did
what was ordained; and so did I.... Lean out a moment from the open
window, and look once more at the sweet green things....
                       [_A silence. He closes the shutter without a word_.]

_Vast subterranean crypts_. ALLADINE _and_ PALOMIDES.
<===>
Would that the world were mine to give it you
    With every quiet hearth and barren waste,
    The maddening freedom of its woods and tides,
    And the bewildering light upon its hills.

Then I would take and break it in my hands
    To see you smile watching it crumble away.
<===>
I trust you. I love you. You will never disappoint me,
Sergius. (Louka is heard singing within the house. They quickly
release each other.) Hush! I can't pretend to talk indifferently
before her: my heart is too full. (Louka comes from the house
with her tray. She goes to the table, and begins to clear it,
with her back turned to them.) I will go and get my hat; and
then we can go out until lunch time. Wouldn't you like that?

Hooray! We've escaped!
<===>
I would I had thy Cashel by the collar:
    He hath escaped me.

          Praises be for ever!
<===>
I’ve thought of that. We must have Aibric with us,
  For he can judge the stars as well as Forgael.

Silence! for you have taken Forgael’s pay.
<===>
I promised to get you that amount, on certain conditions.
Your mind was so taken up with your husband's illness, and you were so
anxious to get the money for your journey, that you seem to have paid
no attention to the conditions of our bargain. Therefore it will not be
amiss if I remind you of them. Now, I promised to get the money on the
security of a bond which I drew up.
