A:
	We are lost in this cave. How much more battery power do we have left?

B:
	But, Thomas dear, the imprudent things you said had
something to do with it, you know.

A:
	I'm afraid you don't quite know how odd a match it would be
for me according to the ideas of English society.

B:
	Whatever is that?

A:
	How much food do we have left? I'm beginning to worry.

B:
	Father, forgive me for all that
I have neglected to do! You shall see how I will try and make up for it!
How hard I shall work!

A:
	I have told you, Joyzelle, his life is in my hands and cannot escape
without my consent. I warned you of it. The poison is doing its work

B:
	I am here, Joyzelle....

A:
	Look! Is that a shaft of light I see?

B:
	_Vast subterranean crypts_. ALLADINE _and_ PALOMIDES.

A:
	Then I would take and break it in my hands
    To see you smile watching it crumble away.

B:
	Yes, I know.

A:
	Hooray! We've escaped!

B:
	Yes, you must stay in the house.

A:
	Better wait here. We shan't be long. There's a young American
gentleman, a Mr Malone, who is driving Mr Robinson down in his new
American steam car.

B:
	Yes, of course: call on all their wives. We must get a
copy of the register and a supply of canvassing cards. No use
calling on people who haven't votes. You'll be a great success as
a canvasser,
