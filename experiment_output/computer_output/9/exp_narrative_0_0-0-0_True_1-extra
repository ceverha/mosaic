Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.
<===>
Well, I thought it should be the young wife of a sailor, who
lies sleeping in strange unrest, and she is dreaming. I fancy I shall do
it so that you will see she is dreaming.

Is there anything else?
<===>
Is there anything--?

Yes.
<===>
Oh, yes I am!

I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.
<===>
I love you! It is you I have loved in her--since the very first
day. I love you!

Then have respect for me--and go!
<===>
That does not matter, Rebecca. We shall be able to go through
with it, for all that--we two trusty friends--you and I.

What do you suppose he meant just now when he said he was
ashamed of himself?
<===>
Why, it is he, Wangel!--he himself! He who you know!

You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.
<===>
Yes, do, dear! I couldn't, just now; and I am sure your
father couldn't either. You speak to him! (Gets up.) Come, Signe, you
and I must have a talk; you must open your heart to me now.--Ah, when
have we ever had a real talk together? (SIGNE goes to her.) Where is
your father?

He went upstairs.
<===>
He was silent--and went back.

Went back! But he'll return!----
<===>
Yes: you're going to heaven; and you're coming back here
before the week's out to tell me so.

With you dead, what keeps me alive?
<===>
[Desperately.] But what's come over you so sudden? You was
saying you loved me--

I'll say that as often as you want me to. It's true.
<===>
Oh, I'll play fair. I'll admit they did--then. But it's
exasperating to know they never give you credit for changing--I almost
said, reforming, One ought to be above the gossip of a town like
this--but say what you like, it does get under your skin.

[With an indulgent smile.] So you'd like to be known as a
reformed character, eh?
<===>
Thank you. Thats a good lad. [Redpenny vanishes]. They all
put up with me, these young chaps, because I'm an old man, a real old
man, not like you. Youre only beginning to give yourself the airs of
age. Did you ever see a boy cultivating a moustache? Well, a middle-aged
doctor cultivating a grey head is much the same sort of spectacle.
