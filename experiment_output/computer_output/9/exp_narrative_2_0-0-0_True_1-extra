Similarity pairs

How are you doing today? I haven't seen you in a while.
<===>
Yes; I almost think I should. But now, for
this summer, I would rather you were like yourself alone, and exactly as
you are.

Do you like me best as I am?
<===>
Good morning. Well, I suppose you can guess what I want you
for?

Mr. Krap told me yesterday that you were not pleased with--
<===>
Yes, that is what I told you yesterday, but--

Really? Now that's hard to believe. 
<===>
[Worried]. What do you see now that's so remarkable?

see in the mirror that you are a thief, a simple, common thief.
Just now, when you sat there in your shirt-sleeves, I noticed that
something was wrong about my book-shelf, but I couldn't make out what it
was,
<===>
LUNN. There you go, like all the rest of them! I ask you, how do
you expect a woman to keep up what you call her sensibility when this
sort of thing has happened to her about three times a week ever since
she was seventeen? It used to upset me and terrify me at first. Then I
got rather a taste for it. It came to a climax with Gregory: that was
why I married him. Then it became a mild lark, hardly worth the
trouble. After that I found it valuable once or twice as a spinal tonic
when I was run down; but now it's an unmitigated bore. I don't mind
your declaration: I daresay it gives you a certain pleasure to make it.
I quite understand that you adore me; but (if you don't mind) I'd
rather you didn't keep on saying so.

Is there then no hope for me?
<===>
Oh, it's you, Christine. There is no one else out there, is there?
How good of you to come!

It's all about finding the balance.
<===>
The end of everything, all the same? How--?

Now you know, John.
<===>
I think not, John.  You had better sit beside me.  [SIR
JOHN _rises and goes across_.]

And what have you been writing about this morning, Mr.
Kelvil?
<===>
And what about the one you have engaged?

That is surprising - I never thought about it like that before.
<===>
That was just what I did! But that was also just what made the
whole thing happen!

How? Try and tell me a little more calmly and consecutively!
<===>
Well, old dear, he wants me; and thats about the long and short of
it. And I must say youre not very nice to me about it. Ive talked to him
like a mother, and tried my best to keep him straight; but I dont deny
I like a bit of fun myself; and we both get a bit giddy when we're
lighthearted. Him and me is a pair, I'm afraid.

Dont talk foolishness, girl. How could you and he be a pair, you
being what you are, and he brought up as he has been, with the example
of a religious woman like Mrs Knox before his eyes?
<===>
[testily] For goodness' sake, don't call him Jack under my
roof [he throws the book violently down on the table, Then, somewhat
relieved, he comes past the table to Octavius, and addresses him at
close quarters with impressive gravity]. Now, Octavius, I know that my
dead friend was right when he said you were a generous lad. I know that
this man was your schoolfellow, and that you feel bound to stand by
him because there was a boyish friendship between you. But I ask you
to consider the altered circumstances. You were treated as a son in my
friend's house. You lived there; and your friends could not be turned
from the door. This Tanner was in and out there on your account almost
from his childhood. He addresses Annie by her Christian name as freely
as you do. Well, while her father was alive, that was her father's
business, not mine. This man Tanner was only a boy to him: his opinions
were something to be laughed at, like a man's hat on a child's head.
But now Tanner is a grown man and Annie a grown woman. And her father
is gone. We don't as yet know the exact terms of his will; but he often
talked it over with me; and I have no more doubt than I have that you're
sitting there that the will appoints me Annie's trustee and guardian.
[Forcibly] Now I tell you, once for all, I can't and I won't have Annie
placed in such a position that she must, out of regard for you, suffer
the intimacy of this fellow Tanner. It's not fair: it's not right: it's
not kind. What are you going to do about it?
