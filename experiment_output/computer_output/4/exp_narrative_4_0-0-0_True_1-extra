Let me get this straight. You did what?
<===>
What does it all mean? I do not understand you. Tell me,
straight out!

A new summer has blossomed in my heart--my eyes have regained
the clearness of youth. And, accordingly, I am now standing where--
<===>
It is all right. I shall feel better after this. I have not cried
for two years. I went into the garden last night to see if our old
theatre were still standing. I see it is. I wept there for the first
time in two years, and my heart grew lighter, and my soul saw more
clearly again. See, I am not crying now. [She takes his hand in hers]
So you are an author now, and I am an actress. We have both been sucked
into the whirlpool. My life used to be as happy as a childâ€™s; I used to
wake singing in the morning; I loved you and dreamt of fame, and what is
the reality? To-morrow morning early I must start for Eltz by train in
a third-class carriage, with a lot of peasants, and at Eltz the educated
trades-people will pursue me with compliments. It is a rough life.

Why are you going to Eltz?
<===>
What are you going to do?

I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.
<===>
Because I am not going to translate it.

But you promised me faithfully.
<===>
Because I want you to get me what you promised me.

What was that?
<===>
What was it?

Get out! GET OUT!
<===>
Get out where?

(_with a bright smile_) Where you, darling, will never go.
<===>
Psha! I know. You think if she once sets eyes on your face
and your uniform your fortune is made. You think that if she could stand
a man like me, with only one eye, and a cross eye at that, she must fall
down at your feet at first sight, eh?

Stand off. [To Patiomkin.] Order them off, if you don't want
a bullet through your silly head.
<===>
[To DORN] You have taken off your hat again! Put it on, you
will catch cold.

I don't care. Don't speak to me again.
<===>
I don't know whether I want to laugh or to cry.

Believe me, you are mistaken about this, Miss Valborg. You
don't see things as plainly as I do.
<===>
JUNO. I don't think we'll talk about it any more. Danger is all
very well when you do escape; but sometimes one doesn't. I tell you
frankly I don't feel as safe as you do--if you really do.

But surely you can do as you please without injuring anyone,
Mrs. Juno. That is the whole secret of your extraordinary charm for me.
<===>
I understand you, Joyzelle.... You must not deny what remains of your
love while I am here.... I leave you to yourself, face to face with
your duty, face to face with your destiny.... Such sacrifices ask
for no witnesses: they demand silence.... The truth is there; it is
cowardly to fly from it.... You will know how to face it when you are
alone.... There is yet time.... I admire you, Joyzelle.... Your life
and your happiness invoke your courage and depend upon a glance....
