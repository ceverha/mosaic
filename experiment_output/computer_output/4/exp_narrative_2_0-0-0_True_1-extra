Similarity pairs

How are you doing today? I haven't seen you in a while.
<===>
Yes; I almost think I should. But now, for
this summer, I would rather you were like yourself alone, and exactly as
you are.

Do you like me best as I am?
<===>
Good morning. Well, I suppose you can guess what I want you
for?

Mr. Krap told me yesterday that you were not pleased with--
<===>
Yes, that is what I told you yesterday, but--

Really? Now that's hard to believe. 
<===>
[Worried]. What do you see now that's so remarkable?

see in the mirror that you are a thief, a simple, common thief.
Just now, when you sat there in your shirt-sleeves, I noticed that
something was wrong about my book-shelf, but I couldn't make out what it
was,
<===>
LUNN. There you go, like all the rest of them! I ask you, how do
you expect a woman to keep up what you call her sensibility when this
sort of thing has happened to her about three times a week ever since
she was seventeen? It used to upset me and terrify me at first. Then I
got rather a taste for it. It came to a climax with Gregory: that was
why I married him. Then it became a mild lark, hardly worth the
trouble. After that I found it valuable once or twice as a spinal tonic
when I was run down; but now it's an unmitigated bore. I don't mind
your declaration: I daresay it gives you a certain pleasure to make it.
I quite understand that you adore me; but (if you don't mind) I'd
rather you didn't keep on saying so.

Is there then no hope for me?
<===>
[consoling her] No, no, no, my child: do not pray. If you
do, you will throw away the main advantage of this place. Written over
the gate here are the words "Leave every hope behind, ye who enter."
Only think what a relief that is! For what is hope? A form of moral
responsibility. Here there is no hope, and consequently no duty, no
work, nothing to be gained by praying, nothing to be lost by doing what
you like. Hell, in short, is a place where you have nothing to do but
amuse yourself. [Don Juan sighs deeply]. You sigh, friend Juan; but if
you dwelt in heaven, as I do, you would realize your advantages.

It's all about finding the balance.
<===>
The whole intellectual world is at war about it. The best
scientists accept it. Teachers are losing their positions for believing
it. Of course, ministers can't believe it.

I should think not. Anyway, what's the use believing a
thing that's so discouraging?
<===>
The trouble is I don't know how to act like a spy. But if things like
that don't come out--there ain't no sayin' what's safe no more.

You are quite right, Mrs. Wolff, quite right. [_To WEHRHAHN._] I must ask
you to examine that package carefully. The handwriting on the slip that
was found in it may lead to a discovery.
<===>
I made a declaration on your behalf, that you intended to
try and repay that sum, but that you should be at liberty to do it in
whatever way you found best. And so--

That is surprising - I never thought about it like that before.
<===>
[To herself.]  I have not seen Olaf alone; but
when I think it over, it is probably best that he know nothing
about it until it is all over.

[Softly, to HEMMING, who has been whispering with
INGEBORG.]  Well, Hemming!  How do you think your master is
disposed?
<===>
Emmy: is that woman there still? If so, tell her once for all
that I cant and wont see her. Do you hear?

Oh, she aint in a hurry: she doesnt mind how long she waits. [She
goes out].
<===>
She always goes when I come in!
