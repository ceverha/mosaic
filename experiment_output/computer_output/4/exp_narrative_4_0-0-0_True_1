A:
	Let me get this straight. You did what?

B:
	A new summer has blossomed in my heart--my eyes have regained
the clearness of youth. And, accordingly, I am now standing where--

A:
	Why are you going to Eltz?

B:
	I am going to town alone. I am sick of this!

A:
	I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.

B:
	But you promised me faithfully.

A:
	What was that?

B:
	It was the train!

A:
	Get out! GET OUT!

B:
	(_with a bright smile_) Where you, darling, will never go.

A:
	Stand off. [To Patiomkin.] Order them off, if you don't want
a bullet through your silly head.

B:
	The doctor has taken off his hat to Satan father of eternal
matter--

A:
	I don't care. Don't speak to me again.

B:
	Believe me, you are mistaken about this, Miss Valborg. You
don't see things as plainly as I do.

A:
	But surely you can do as you please without injuring anyone,
Mrs. Juno. That is the whole secret of your extraordinary charm for me.

B:
	Lancéor! Lancéor!... He cannot hear me.... His eyes are wide open....
Lancéor, I am here, I am bending over your eyes.... Look at me, look
at me!... No, he does not see me!...
