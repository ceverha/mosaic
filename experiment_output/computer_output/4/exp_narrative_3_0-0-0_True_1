A:
	I can't believe you threw that ball over the fence. Now you're going to have to go into that dark, scary, spooky forest all by yourself!

B:
	Miss Claire! Miss Claire! The work of years!

A:
	It's so much more than--I'd see.

B:
	Keeping this house alone, sell all I have;
    Go to some distant country and come again
    With many herds of cows and ships of grain.

A:
	Hurry up! You're making me worried. [hears scream] What was that? Hold on!

B:
	Yes, dear?

A:
	I am afraid, my dear Mrs. Riis, we have
come at an inconvenient time for your daughter?

B:
	Nonsense!--we know all about that.

A:
	It hurts so much, make it stop!

B:
	Go on.

A:
	Well, as I said, it's simple enough. The Herr Councillor was
here.

B:
	Thea's pure soul was in that book.

A:
	Be quiet. 

B:
	He made me promise that, on the day on which his daughter was to
be presented at the palace as the King's betrothed, I would stand up
in some public place where she would pass by,

A:
	May I be allowed to ask a question? (Shouts of
"Yes!" and "No!" and laughter are heard.)

B:
	Yes, I destroyed your house last night; but you and
Olaf and all the rest of you out there have done me a greater
wrong.  The world was to me a festive hall which belonged to the
Great Father.
