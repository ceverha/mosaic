I can't believe you threw that ball over the fence. Now you're going to have to go into that dark, scary, spooky forest all by yourself!
<===>
(_roughly_) 'Right to you!' And that's all you know of
adventure--and of anguish. Do you know it is you--world of which you're
so true a flower--makes me have to leave? You're there to hold the door
shut! Because you're young and of a gayer world, you think I can't _see_
them--those old men? Do you know why you're so sure of yourself? Because
you can't _feel_. Can't feel--the limitless--out there--a sea just over
the hill. I will not stay with you! (_buries her hands in the earth
around the Edge Vine. But suddenly steps back from it as she had from_
ELIZABETH) And I will not stay with _you! (grasps it as we grasp what we
would kill, is trying to pull it up. They all step forward in horror.

Miss Claire! Miss Claire! The work of years!
<===>
Breath of Life is here, Miss Claire.

Look--and see--what you see.
<===>
You see we know you now, Engstrand.

Hurry up! You're making me worried. [hears scream] What was that? Hold on!
<===>
Wait till you read the others I'm going to do!
(_After a slight pause--with a good-natured grin._) Here I am talking
about myself again! Why don't you call me down when I start that
drivel? But you don't know how good it is to have your dreams coming

No. I don't know. But I love to hear you talk of
yours.
<===>
Yes, you have. I know what you all think of me. Dont imagine I'm
sore about it. I forgive you.

That was old Walpole, I know. Don't grieve, Walpole. I'm
perfectly happy. I'm not in pain. I don't want to live. Ive escaped from
myself. I'm in heaven, immortal in the heart of my beautiful Jennifer.
I'm
<===>
I'm going to tell you. I did it because I was in love with you.

It hurts so much, make it stop!
<===>
So it does.

Stop, Rank; this is sheer madness. Stop, I tell you! (RANK stops
playing, and NORA suddenly stands still. HELMER goes up to her.) I could
never have believed it. You have forgotten everything I taught you.
<===>
Yes: I had rather you did go than mistake me about that. I hate
and dread you; and my husband knows it. If you are not here when he
comes back, he will believe that I disobeyed him and drove you away.

Stop, stop, stop, I tell you. Don't do that. (Putting his hand
to his breast as if to a wound.) He wrung my heart by being a man. Need
you tear it by being a woman?
<===>
No. [Patting the soldier on the back]. You should
give the man a cross for his devotion. I could not go on eating him; so
I brought him along with me.

He made me promise that, on the day on which his daughter was to
