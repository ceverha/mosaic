(_roughly_) 'Right to you!' And that's all you know of
adventure--and of anguish. Do you know it is you--world of which you're
so true a flower--makes me have to leave? You're there to hold the door
shut! Because you're young and of a gayer world, you think I can't _see_
them--those old men? Do you know why you're so sure of yourself? Because
you can't _feel_. Can't feel--the limitless--out there--a sea just over
the hill. I will not stay with you! (_buries her hands in the earth
around the Edge Vine. But suddenly steps back from it as she had from_
ELIZABETH) And I will not stay with _you! (grasps it as we grasp what we

Miss Claire! Miss Claire! The work of years!
<===>
My gracious! It's Miss Addy, Lady Utterword, Mrs
Hushabye's sister: the one I told the captain about. [Calling]. Coming,
Miss, coming.

Oh, is that you, Nurse? How are you? You don't look a
day older. Is nobody at home? Where is Hesione? Doesn't she expect me?
Where are the servants? Whose luggage is that on the steps?
<===>
To be sure. And a miner like that is very interesting, if you look upon
him in that way. Why, there are places where you never see one; but If
you have them daily before your eyes ...

Hurry up! You're making me worried. [hears scream] What was that? Hold on!
<===>
POPOV. Nothing. You may go. But--wait a moment. No, go on, go on. I
hate you. Or--no; don't go. Oh, if you knew how angry I was, how angry!
[_She throws the revolver on to the chair._] My finger is swollen from
this thing. [_She angrily tears her handkerchief._] What are you
standing there for? Get out!

Farewell!
<===>
A farewell message?

I am glad to hear it!
<===>
I am extremely pleased to hear it.

It hurts so much, make it stop!
<===>
Lancéor, this is terrible!... I never tremble, but I am trembling
to-day.... Perhaps it means your life; and it already means mine....
What is that light which rises so quickly?... It has come to threaten
us, it is going to betray us!...

I am here!...
<===>
I am, I usually am!

A very clever woman.  Knows perfectly well what a demmed
fool I am—knows it as well as I do myself.
<===>
I gave him what he likes best. You do not know how vain this fool is.
He likes nothing so well as a feather.

Be quiet. 
<===>
Be quiet, will you?

Shut up, can’t you?
<===>
Shut up!

[_taking her by the arm_] Hold your tongue, I tell you.
<===>
You mustn't do that, my dear. (They put her into her
chair.) Now! What is your last bit of news?
