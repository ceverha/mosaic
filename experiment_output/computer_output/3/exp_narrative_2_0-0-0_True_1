A:
	How are you doing today? I haven't seen you in a while.

B:
	Yes: it's hard for me to know anything about you if you
never tell me anything.

A:
	I?  Nothing.  When once I have given you the
packet----

B:
	Aagot!

A:
	Really? Now that's hard to believe. 

B:
	And I fancy it will be so
cheering for you, too--here in this out-of-the-way place-to know within
yourself that you are, so to say, helping me to create.

A:
	I do want calm. But mine would have to be a calm I--worked my
way to. A calm all prepared for me--would stink.

B:
	I _have_ thought it over--and you will never get me to do
anything else.

A:
	It's all about finding the balance.

B:
	But what has that to do with us?

A:
	Just this much, that if I had been an ordinary stay-at-home man, a
great many things would not have happened.

B:
	Men are not like that.

A:
	That is surprising - I never thought about it like that before.

B:
	You have to go and be a pillar of
society, brother-in-law.

A:
	But at least I shall not be bored. The service of the Life
Force has that advantage, at all events. So fare you well, Senor Satan.

B:
	What next!
