A:
	Let me get this straight. You did what?

B:
	whole lot of things; but I shall begin with the ending. We must
dissolve this concubinage.

A:
	I welcome progress too, Mr. Bernick.

B:
	So you see it would be an easy matter for me to set on foot
some testimonial, if necessary.

A:
	I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.

B:
	But you are not ready to go, Sannaes! You have not finished
your work here yet! There is what I just spoke of--and something else
that dates farther back than that.

A:
	[Notices LADY KIRSTEN and her retinue.]  Lady Kirsten!
you here?  Well, I am glad of that.

B:
	You will be the pattern secretary, Gerald.  [_Talks to
him_.]

A:
	Get out! GET OUT!

B:
	Rest easy, little one--you do.

A:
	Do you know, Captain Paquito, that I've married no less
than seventeen men (Brassbound stares) to other women. And they all
opened the subject by saying that they would never marry anybody but me.

B:
	Men are not like that.

A:
	I don't care. Don't speak to me again.

B:
	Nothing stays at home. Not even the corn stays at home. If only the
wind wouldn't blow! Why can't I have my field to myself? Why can't I
keep what's mine? All these years I've worked to make it better.

A:
	I have never interfered with you. Go on, play the
man-of-the world as much as you like, but have the courage to admit it.

B:
	Svava--look at your father!
