Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.
<===>
Well, I thought it should be the young wife of a sailor, who
lies sleeping in strange unrest, and she is dreaming. I fancy I shall do
it so that you will see she is dreaming.

Is there anything else?
<===>
Is there anything--?

Yes.
<===>
Ah, yes, that! Yes, yes ... I believe so ... but nothing definite.

I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.
<===>
O, but wait. I understand you. Thomas doesn’t understand your thoughts,
but I understand them. Wasn’t I telling you I was just like you once?

Like me? Did you ever see the other things, the things beyond?
<===>
You had too great things to think 
of — and now I see how they've changed you. You 
hold yourself in another way.

(Triumphant, to prove how right 
she has been.) You carry it better than you did!
<===>
You don't say so. Now really, who'd have thought it! How jolly
it must be to be able to go to the theatre for nothing! I must ask him
to get me a few tickets occasionally. But isn't it ridiculous for a
man to talk like that! I'm hanged if he don't take what he sees on the
stage quite seriously.

You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.
<===>
Yes, do, dear! I couldn't, just now; and I am sure your
father couldn't either. You speak to him! (Gets up.) Come, Signe, you
and I must have a talk; you must open your heart to me now.--Ah, when
have we ever had a real talk together? (SIGNE goes to her.) Where is
your father?

He went upstairs.
<===>
She went away?

Yes.
<===>
Yes, yes it is.

With you dead, what keeps me alive?
<===>
[_gravely_] Ah, my dear! If I hadn’t you what would become of
me! [_A silence_] But you’re telling me _nothing_. You don’t seem to be
telling me the truth—you’re hiding something from me—there _is_ some
difficulty, I’m certain of it. If there wasn’t you’d say there wasn’t,
you wouldn’t put me off—you’d tell me what Madame Bernin said.

Well—there is something.
<===>
No?  Is it really?

Yes, I’m of age to-day.  Quite an important day in my
life, isn’t it?  That is why I am giving this party to-night.  Do sit
down.  [_Still arranging flowers_.]

--is excellent. Good feeling and keeping order are much more excellent
than the love of Bosatsu. 'I think of these matters and know little of
anything else. It is from my own heart that I am lost, wandering. But if
I begin talking I shall keep on talking until dawn. Go to bed, good
father; I will sleep too.' He seemed to be going to his bedroom, but
suddenly his figure disappeared, and the cottage became a field of grass.
The priest passes the night under the pine trees.
