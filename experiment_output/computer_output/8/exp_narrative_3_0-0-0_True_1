B:
	Farewell!

A:
	My----?  But I am not Count Sture.

B:
	Ah, and you think you'll leave my house without my curse!
(_He lifts his arm as though to curse her_) You----

A:
	It hurts so much, make it stop!

B:
	Stop, Rank; this is sheer madness. Stop, I tell you! (RANK stops

B:
	And I am a feminine prig.

A:
	Be quiet. 

B:
	Shut up, canâ€™t you?

A:

interrupted--bitterly._] And there she was standing behind us, and the
Second pointing at us like a man you'd hear in a circus would be
saying:

B:
	[Cunningly]. And you didn't give yourself up?
