A:
	I can't believe you threw that ball over the fence. Now you're going to have to go into that dark, scary, spooky forest all by yourself!

B:
	Hell nope. No thanks. 

C:
	Yeah, maybe tomorrow. But that seems like a bad idea, especially since it's still hailing outside.

A:
	[Thoughtfully.] What if it only seems--?

B:
	It's definitely hailing. I'm the one with the damaged car, remember? 

C:
	Ah yes, that was when we met that weird AI. Wait... does your nametag say Moller?

A:
	Hurry up! You're making me worried. [hears scream] What was that? Hold on!

B:
	Greg, the AI's stuck in a loop. This one hasn't reached self-awareness. Wait are we trying to West World this play?

C:
	Yeah, also that scream might have been that plop plop mushy poop you've been dealing with.

A:
	Not get out! Why not? You have ships in the east harbor.

B:
	Great, now the AI knows about my bowel issues. Hey, do you have any tips for getting a balanced diet with enough fiber? 

C:
	Ships in her harbor that's for sure!! To make it "get out" I recommend a healthy diet based on natural plants and fungi. 

A:
	It hurts so much, make it stop!

B:
	I don't think fungi's going to help this fun guy.

C:
	Hmm. Yeah, vegetables have a laxative effect if you haven't been eating a healthy diet. Just stick it out! 

A:
	O, that I should have to endure such a plague! O, I ache all over! O,
I am pulled to pieces! This is the way you pay me all the good I have
done you!

B:
	So who's going to get the ball that went over the fence??

C:
	Fine. I'll do it. You two go get your diets in order, while I bowel out and head over the fence.

A:
	Be quiet. 

B:
	That tells you how bad that pun was.

C:
	Honestly if I'm not told to be quiet after a pun, I don't even know if anyone got it.

A:
	We never do that unless the patient mentions the subject
himself, and very seldom even then. It depends entirely on the case. But
we mustn't sit here; perhaps I had better go into the next room; it will
look more natural.

B:
	Is this the West World moment we've built up to?

C:
	Also, is your name Moller?
