A:
	We are lost in this cave. How much more battery power do we have left?

B:
	I think just enough to make it through the night

A:
	Your mother is not well. She
was coughing in the night.

B:
	I know but there's no way we can help her if we don't find this potion of Valcur.

A:
	How much food do we have left? I'm beginning to worry.

B:
	We have enough! Now stop asking questions and lets get going. This place gives me a bad vibd.

A:
	In milk. Dont set him coughing.

B:
	What are you going off about now?

A:
	Look! Is that a shaft of light I see?

B:
	It is. Lets go. Before we lose it.

A:
	Yes, I do not see that I have any choice.

B:
	Shut up and hurry. We don't have that much time left. The tunnel will close by dawn.

A:
	Hooray! We've escaped!

B:
	Yes. Now where does the map say to go now

A:
	War to the knife, I hope! We will get our knives to their
throats, Doctor!

B:
	Enough of the foolishness. Give me the map we must hurry if we are to make it to the Tomb of Binyo
