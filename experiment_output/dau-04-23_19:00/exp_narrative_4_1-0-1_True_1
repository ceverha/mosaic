A:
	Let me get this straight. You did what?

B:
	I had intercourse with your dog. I'm sorry.

A:
	God be praised, Little Father: you are still spared to us.

B:
	Thank you. You are very kind. I hope that the world will accept my acts against those beautiful animals that way you accept me.

A:
	I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.

B:
	I. I don't know. The feeling and urge to have my penis inserted into those frail hairy beast is just too satisfying to not do it. Its a feeling like no other and I cannot live without it. (Mouth starts to water)

A:
	I certainly don't understand how your marrying that object
[indicating Mangan] will console you for not being able to marry Hector.

B:
	They are no object sir. They are my lovers. My friend. My companion for christ sakes. Hector? Hector can never fill me the way these wonderful creatures fill me. I cannot do with hector the way they do with me. Please ignore this conversatoin and let me live the life I deserve

A:
	Get out! GET OUT!

B:
	NO! I WILL NOT LEAVE UNTIL YOU ACCEPT ME FOR WHO I AM AND WHAT I DO. I FUCK DOGS. I FUCK THEM GOOD. I LOVE FUCKING THOSE LITTLE HAIRY TAIL CHASING FUCKERS AND I WILL CONTINUE TO FUCK THEM UNTIL THE DAY I DIE. YOU AND YOUR SAD LITTLE LIFE CAN DO DIE IN A HOLE BEFORE I WILL EVEN THNK TWICE OF STOPING.

A:
	Tell me, Dina--is that the only reason you are coming away? Am I
nothing to you?

B:
	As a woman with a man's penis, I come here only out of respect for you and for my love. I will never be able to accept my reality until i close all the doors of my past life.

A:
	I don't care. Don't speak to me again.

B:
	Fine. You were never good in bed anyways. (Walks away)

A:
	[Impatiently.] For goodness sake, don't you start to pity
yourself!

B:
	I will never. Good day you worthless sackless piece of shit.
