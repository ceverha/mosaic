A:
	I can't believe you threw that ball over the fence. Now you're going to have to go into that dark, scary, spooky forest all by yourself!

B:
	Shit. Wait, you mean, you're not coming with me?

A:
	Delighted, my dear Loony. Come to lunch on Saturday next week.
Bring your motor and take me down to Hertford.

B:
	Fine, coward, I'll go alone. [B climbs over fence, tearing their shirt in the process]

A:
	Hurry up! You're making me worried. [hears scream] What was that? Hold on!

B:
	I think I see the ball. I'm going to go grab it!

A:
	You are ill, Nora; you are delirious; I almost think you are out
of your mind.

B:
	[B grabs what looks like the ball. Their hand sticks to the sphere, which remains attached to the ground.] Help! My hand is stuck! I don't think this is our ball.

A:
	It hurts so much, make it stop!

B:
	I'm serious! Get over here!

A:
	And you are going south, the girls tell me.

B:
	[Spikes come up from the ground in a circle around B. Teeth. They begin to close on B.] Get over here! Help! It's going to eat me! HELP!

A:
	Be quiet. 

B:
	[Those last words emanate from the monster. It's clear that B's fallen into a trap. A is the monster.] Don't do this, please. I only wanted my ball back. I don't want to die.

A:
	[_Holding him back._] Wittig, Wittig! Don't lose your head!

B:
	[A's jaws close on B's head. B's muffled voice issues from A.] HRUMMMMPFRRRARRGGGRRERRRR!
