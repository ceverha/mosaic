A:
	I can't believe you threw that ball over the fence. Now you're going to have to go into that dark, scary, spooky forest all by yourself!

B:
	Its alright. I love that feeling you get when your scared and you feel like you are going to pee yourself. I live for moments like these.

A:
	Forget!

B:
	you seriously forgot all those times I peed myself while playing hide and seek?

A:
	Hurry up! You're making me worried. [hears scream] What was that? Hold on!

B:
	What was what? I didn't hear anything, chill out.

A:
	The fight is over now, as far as I am concerned.

B:
	OMG she texted you back? She aplogized? turn your brightness down on your phone. I don't want the neighbors to see us

A:
	It hurts so much, make it stop!

B:
	ugh, now what? [pause] she blocked you? put your phone away. We need to go get that ball. My brother is going to be so tilted if I tell him we lost his favorite baseball

A:
	All right. Then I'm one too many here. You c'n bill an' coo. [_He is
dressed for the street as it is and hence proceeds to go. Close by BRUNO
he stands still._] You scamp! You worried your father into his grave.
Your sister might better ha' let you starve behind some fence rather'n
raise you an' litter the earth with another criminal like you. I'll be
back in half an hour! But I won't be alone. I'll have the sergeant with
me!

B:
	Dude, chill. this isn't illegal. No cops are gonna come

A:
	Be quiet. 

B:
	[whispers] oh shit, the cops are here

A:
	In what direction did you go?

B:
	we need to stay right here, as long as we are behind this bush they won't be able to see us.
