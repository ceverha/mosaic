A:
	How are you doing today? I haven't seen you in a while.

B:
	I'm doing alright! I know, you had that thing in Spain, so I guess that's why?

A:
	Peter Kanzler is with us--secretly, you understand.

B:
	Oh, god, Peter? Just as long as I don't have to talk to him

A:
	Really? Now that's hard to believe. 

B:
	What? Peter really annoys me

A:
	Come, Julia: you don't expect me to admire you for your
moral qualities, do you? (She turns and looks hard at him. He starts
up apprehensively and backs away from her. She rises and follows him
up slowly and intently.)

B:
	Jeremy, what are you talking about? You know Peter pulled that bullshit in high school

A:
	It's all about finding the balance.

B:
	No, I have absolutely no interest in talking to him

A:
	[_Ironically_.] That has always been the case?

B:
	Yes. You know that.

A:
	That is surprising - I never thought about it like that before.

B:
	Have you ever thought about anything?

A:
	Thinking is for old women--doing has been my life.

B:
	What's wrong with being an old woman?
