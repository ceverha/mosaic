A:
	How are you doing today? I haven't seen you in a while.

B:
	Oh, impossible! I hope not.

A:
	[_With a jerk of his head back on his shoulders, as if he had
received a punch full in the face--raging._] I see yuh, all in white! I
see yuh, yuh white-faced tart, yuh! Hairy ape, huh? I'll hairy ape yuh!
[_He bends down and grips at the street curbing as if to pluck it out
and hurl it. Foiled in this, snarling with passion, he leaps to the
lamp-post on the corner and tries to pull it up for a club. Just at
that moment a bus is heard rumbling up. A fat, high-hatted, spatted
gentleman runs out from the side street. He calls out plaintively:
"Bus! Bus! Stop there!" and runs full tilt into the bending, straining
YANK, who is bowled off his balance._]

B:
	[Calmly and quietly.]  My illness will never be cured, Borkman.

A:
	Really? Now that's hard to believe. 

B:
	My mind is not clear--I can't understand. Servant--water! I
have fallen in love like any young man. [_He takes her hand and she
cries with pain._] I love you! [_He kneels._] I love you as I have never
loved before. Twelve women I jilted, nine jilted me, but not one of them
all have I loved as I love you. I am conquered, lost; I lie at your feet
like a fool and beg for your hand. Shame and disgrace! For five years I
haven't been in love; I thanked the Lord for it, and now I am caught,
like a carriage tongue in another carriage. I beg for your hand! Yes or
no? Will you?--Good! [_He gets up and goes quickly to the door._

A:
	The horror?

B:
	Hush. For shame, Tavy!

A:
	It's all about finding the balance.

B:
	He was gushin' with hextra piety hisself arter two sips.
People carn't drink like they huseter. (Dismissing the subject and
bustling away from the hearth.) Well, James: it's time to lock up. Mr.
Morchbanks: shall I 'ave the pleasure of your company for a bit of the
way home?

A:
	Holloway Gaol. Was that safe enough?

B:
	Thank you.
Are you sure I am not disturbing you?

A:
	That is surprising - I never thought about it like that before.

B:
	An eerie night!  How all my thoughts are tossed
About in circles!  Did I dream perchance?
Ah, real or fancied,--now I am awake,--
Whichever way I turn I see her form.

A:
	Aha! (Calls out.) Come in!

B:
	I charge you next with having again, this very
night, with the aid of these same secret powers, met Olaf up
here, and furthermore that you keep him concealed in here!
