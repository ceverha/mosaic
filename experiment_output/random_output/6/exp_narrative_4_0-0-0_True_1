A:
	Let me get this straight. You did what?

B:
	But I'm not 
of the stuff of which churchmen are made!

A:
	I'll have no dealings with you at all.

B:
	Tonight all will be decided, dear Ellida--Ellida (bursting out).
Yes, think! The decision so near--the decision for one's whole life!

A:
	I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.

B:
	[Lays her arms on MRS. SOLNESS'S knees, and looks up at her
affectionately.] Dear Mrs. Solness--tell me what things you mean!

A:
	If you mean that you will be a treasure to him, he thinks
so now; and you can keep him thinking so if you like.

B:
	Help! help! They are killing Charles. Help!

A:
	Get out! GET OUT!

B:
	And I have sworn that I won't slacken in his service until I've
drawn my last breath!

A:
	[Goes up behind him and lays her hands on his shoulders.]
Oswald, my dear boy--has it shaken you very much?

B:
	Then come, come!  The horses are waiting below on the
hill.

A:
	I don't care. Don't speak to me again.

B:
	Thank you.

A:
	Certainly.

B:
	Never fear, sir. We know how to respict a brave innimy.
