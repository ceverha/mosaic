A:
	Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.

B:
	Oh, that's very clever of you, pettikins. Very clever.
Alfred, you could never have lived up to Ellie. You must be content with
a little share of me.

A:
	They have tied my hands with cords; they have bound my eyes with
bands.... I think my hands are bleeding....

B:
	[Laying her two hands upon his shoulders.] And I say that I
have half a mind to put my arms round your neck, and kiss you.

A:
	I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.

B:
	Well, if we have got to that last hope, father, then we are indeed in
bad straits.... Shall I perhaps open a dram-shop in Chicago, or a
cattle business with my paternal capital? Yes? Would you have done it?

A:
	I couldn't have helped laughing even if you had been, Mr
Dunn. So Ellie has hypnotized him. What fun!

B:
	Do you know whose money it was?

A:
	You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.

B:
	Ah,--some little difficulty about it, I suppose?

A:
	Who bade you, pray, thrust yourself into the battle of the
Delta, uttering the barbarous cries of your native land, and affirming
yourself a match for any four of the Egyptians, to whom you applied
unseemly epithets?

B:
	It is useless, Madam. No one will be admitted.

A:
	With you dead, what keeps me alive?

B:
	On the other hand we have three Social-Democrats among us. They
are not on speaking terms; and they have put before us three distinct
and incompatible views of Social-Democracy.

A:
	And he certainly must admit that it is not what we have
deserved; indeed it is more than a respected and well-bred family can
put up with.

B:
	Look here, Saranoff; you're getting the worst of
this.
