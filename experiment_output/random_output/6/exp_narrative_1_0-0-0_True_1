A:
	We are lost in this cave. How much more battery power do we have left?

B:
	I regret to say, Miss Chiltern, that I have no influence
at all over my son.  I wish I had.  If I had, I know what I would make
him do.

A:
	Certainly, certainly. (He follows Paramore ignominiously.)

B:
	Ornulf and his sons come in peace.

A:
	How much food do we have left? I'm beginning to worry.

B:
	You won’t tell me that I have been imprudent because I have not
disposed of my wife’s dowry till after the honeymoon—

A:
	I see that you still have the same wild soul
As of old--

B:
	I dunno. Maybe he killed us. Will Owens' family was
massacred just after this. Like as not my cookie Indian helped out
there. Something kind of uncertain about the Indians.

A:
	Look! Is that a shaft of light I see?

B:
	All right, Doctor.

A:
	They think he is going to preach again when he awakes,
that's why they are dancing. When he wakes one of them will go and call
the others.

B:
	A sad thought, doctor, and that's why we're going to give
them an ovation, as the saying is. Ah! Yes--ah! yes. The glad summertime
will soon be over now. Soon all ways will be barred, as they say in the
tragedy.

A:
	Hooray! We've escaped!

B:
	[In despair, struggling with himself.]  Let it be as you
wish then, mother!  Yes, by all the saints!  I shall answer.
Alfhild! you are mistaken!  I am not your bridegroom.

A:
	I have come to look for work.

B:
	This knowledge, that comes straight from thy simple and timid heart,
awes me, for it cannot be thine own. [_The people, hounded on by
Amasai, jostle the Galilean_] Back! In the Name of Him Who cometh, keep
back. Leave him alone! [_People retreat._]
