A:
	I can't believe you threw that ball over the fence. Now you're going to have to go into that dark, scary, spooky forest all by yourself!

B:
	And what about the daughter?

A:
	Wait! I don't see, after you've led him on to this point, how you'll
ever justify all this to Baron von Kanoldt.

B:
	A letter gravely compromising one’s position.  I am only
putting an imaginary case.

A:
	Hurry up! You're making me worried. [hears scream] What was that? Hold on!

B:
	O Erich, if you knew with what awful, with what horrible names papa
overwhelmed me in his rage. And I had to be silent through it all. I
might have said something that would have silenced all his lofty moral
discourses and made him quite helpless before me. I was almost on the
point of saying it, too. But I felt so ashamed for him! My tongue refused
to form the words! I couldn't say it, Erich! Finally mama had to
intervene. He struck me! For eight or nine hours he locked me in a dark
alcove--to break my stubbornness, as he put it, Erich. Well, he won't
succeed! He won't break it!

A:
	Do you know, Captain Paquito, that I've married no less
than seventeen men (Brassbound stares) to other women. And they all
opened the subject by saying that they would never marry anybody but me.

B:
	How do you know that, Schimmel?

A:
	It hurts so much, make it stop!

B:
	LUNN. I really don't know. I'm getting hopelessly confused.

A:
	You must just go ahead an' drink the waters. They'll cure you.

B:
	shall stay in _my_ home.

A:
	Be quiet. 

B:
	Faith in what ?

A:
	Save me, Wangel! Don't you see him there? Why, he is standing
there!

B:
	No — it's encumbered!
