A:
	How are you doing today? I haven't seen you in a while.

B:
	We are such birds of passage, my dear madam, that we can really never
plan for the future.

A:
	Something that happened a long time ago.

B:
	[_Laughing disrespectfully._] Mourning! What on earth do you
take me for? As if I didn't know why you wore this black domino and why
you buried yourself within these four walls. Such a secret! So romantic!
Some knight will pass the castle, gaze up at the windows, and think to
himself: "Here dwells the mysterious Tamara who, for love of her
husband, has buried herself within four walls." Oh, I understand the
art!

A:
	Really? Now that's hard to believe. 

B:
	There--something moved. It must be Gertrude. [_Goes to door C. and
calls_.] "Gertrude!!!"

A:
	My dear Mitchener, the moon is outside practical politics. Id
swop it for a cooling station tomorrow with Germany or any other Power
sufficiently military in its way of thinking to attach any importance to
it.

B:
	And think of the storm that was raging two days ago!

A:
	It's all about finding the balance.

B:
	My name is Joyzelle.

A:
	CLANDON (anxiously, as she pours out his tea). Phil: there is
something the matter with Gloria. Has anything happened? (Phil and Dolly
look at one another and stifle a laugh.) What is it?

B:
	[Her eyes narrowing.] Ain't you smart! Well, I got yours, too,
without no trouble. You're me forty years from now. That's you! [She
gives a hard little laugh.]

A:
	That is surprising - I never thought about it like that before.

B:
	It seems that you've been dreaming of your first little boy who died,
Mrs. John.

A:
	Oh, you mean the couple of lines she wrote to him on Ulrik
Brendel's behalf?

B:
	What's yours? I'm not your swineherd.
