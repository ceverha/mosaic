A:
	Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.

B:
	It may be. You see I haven't quite forgotten the trick.

A:
	Very well: I'll take it with pleasure if you'll give it to
me.

B:
	Ah, by the way, I can give you news of your deserter. (TJAELDE
looks surprised.) I mean your lieutenant!

A:
	I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.

B:
	I don't know. Perhaps it was you that cut her lip.

A:
	Of course he is; I certainly would not come without him. Why do
you look so tragical? And why are you sitting here in the gloom, sewing
white things? There has not been a death in the family, has there?

B:
	Yes, I do: all matches are unwise. It's unwise to be born; it's
unwise to be married; it's unwise to live; and it's unwise to die.

A:
	You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.

B:
	You have finished your invention!

A:
	There is no place
but will be lonesome to us from this out, and
we thinking on our seven years in Alban.

B:
	I heard you call him by it. Don't try to deceive me.

A:
	With you dead, what keeps me alive?

B:
	And what?  Say forth!

A:
	Prevent her â€” head her off!

B:
	GRACE. 
Surely you're aware of the fewness of your relatives.
