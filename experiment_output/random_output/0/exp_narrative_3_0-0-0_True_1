	I can't believe you threw that ball over the fence. Now you're going to have to go into that dark, scary, spooky forest all by yourself!

B:
	MRS. FRESHVILLE.

A:
	What does he mean?

B:
	Who?

A:
	Hurry up! You're making me worried. [hears scream] What was that? Hold on!

B:
	Good-bye to you--you must go now, before he returns!

A:
	Very likely.

B:
	Do you know, Captain Paquito, that I've married no less
than seventeen men (Brassbound stares) to other women. And they all
opened the subject by saying that they would never marry anybody but me.

A:
	It hurts so much, make it stop!

B:
	But this is so frightful to me, mother. To have to speak
to you about such things!

A:
	Nothing.

B:
	I was prepared for that, and so--(takes a revolver from
his breast pocket)--I provided myself with this.

A:
	Be quiet. 

B:
	Yes. There was nothing else to be done.

A:
	Go right ahead with your preachin'.

B:
	And her behavior?
