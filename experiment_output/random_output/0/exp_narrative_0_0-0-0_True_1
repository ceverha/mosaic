A:
	Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.

B:
	Cry aloud,
  That when we are driven out we come again
  Like a great wind that runs out of the waste
  To blow the tables flat; and thereupon
  Lie down upon the threshold till the King
  Restore to us the ancient right of the poets.

A:
	Well, that's just why we are at the Springs. Do as the princess does:
take the waters religiously.

B:
	Whats the use of that if they dont choose to believe it? You
dont believe it yourself, or you wouldnt pay policemen to twist their
arms. Whats the good of pretending? Thats all our respectability is,
pretending, pretending, pretending. Thank heaven Ive had it knocked out
of me once for all!

A:
	I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.

B:
	You hear how she answers me, this daughter of yours?

A:
	Will you dine with me to-day, Richard? (Richard _shakes his head_.)

B:
	He has not, nor any sort of a heart for a frolic.

A:
	You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.

B:
	Oh, if it were nothing more than that! I was so proud of papa! And now I
tremble to think of even your finding it out. You'd despise us!

A:
	[Not seeming to have heard her question--sadly.] You vas
vaiting, you say? You vasn't vaiting for me, Ay bet.

B:
	[Looks at him and rises.] Oho!

A:
	With you dead, what keeps me alive?

B:
	Yes, I brought it with me in
case you should--

A:
	Far beneath. On the lower slopes; in the thickest parts of the forest.
Places your ordinary town-folk could never get through--

B:
	Take me away this second or I'll
go on without you and never speak again to you till the day I die!
