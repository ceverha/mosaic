	He feels the indignity, but not 
the loss; and he had never dreamed that with you,

A:
	Oh yes, I think so. Oh certainly. I--

B:

A:
	How much food do we have left? I'm beginning to worry.

B:
	[As before.]  Well, briefly, he should have learnt that the axe
sits loose in my hand, as you said but now.

A:
	An' 'twas that as got him in worse'n ever. He should ha' let it be.

B:
	No, no, Prince--can't be done.

A:
	You will see--that now and then a Sabbath peace will descend on
us.

B:
	I do not know. But how?
