A:
	I can't believe you threw that ball over the fence. Now you're going to have to go into that dark, scary, spooky forest all by yourself!

B:
	[Suppressing a smile.] Are you really not to be persuaded,
even now, to pass the night under my roof?

A:
	Upon my soul I should like to be in the magistrate's shoes and
judge this case. The lad is probably not innocent, one can't be sure,
but we do know that the girl is guilty, if there is any guilt in the
matter.

B:
	"The Dutchman went to grass, a beaten man."

A:
	Hurry up! You're making me worried. [hears scream] What was that? Hold on!

B:
	[Whilst MRS. SOLNESS is carried into the house.] Run down for the
doctor--

A:
	No, no: it is not that I am so clever, but that the others
are so stupid.

B:
	Are they coming hither, Jael?

A:
	It hurts so much, make it stop!

B:
	I won't see him. (Dismissing 
Fanny, getting her off.) Meet him — stop him — 
send him away! (Exit Fanny.) I won't see him! 
(After an instant.) I can't! (After another instant.) 
I oughtn't!

A:
	Cape Town.

B:
	Joyzelle will tell you in the first kisses, free from all anxiety,
which you will exchange after this victory. They will veil better
than my poor words what, in this proof, appears unpardonable.... The
proof was dangerous and almost insurmountable.... Joyzelle could have
chosen a different course.... She might have yielded, sacrificed
herself, sacrificed her love, despaired, I know not what!... She
would not have been the Joyzelle that was expected.... There was but
one path traced by destiny; she entered upon it, followed it to the
end and saved your life in saving her own love....

A:
	Be quiet. 

B:
	I hate it! (_With deep passion._) I wish it was poison!

A:
	Yes, and without suspecting it! That was the amusing part of it.

B:
	Tell me, Theresa, did they describe this lady to you?
