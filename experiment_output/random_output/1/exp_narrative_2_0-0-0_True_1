A:
	How are you doing today? I haven't seen you in a while.

B:
	What do you mean by that? As much of it as you can?

A:
	Then it is--out. (_from where she stands she turns slowly to the
plant_) You weren't. You are.

B:
	I see. Nevertheless, I shall continue my reading. [He takes up his
book] Let me see, we had come to the grain-dealer and the rats.

A:
	Really? Now that's hard to believe. 

B:
	And it’s leaving me lone you are? Come back here, Sarah Casey. Come
back here, I’m saying; or if it’s off you must go, leave me the two
little coppers you have, the way I can walk up in a short while, and
get another pint for my sleep.

A:
	The sight of human cruelty maddens me. The woman is dying and
she has a mother and father whom she loves, and longs to see once more
before she dies. They know that she is dying and that she loves them
still, but with diabolical cruelty, as if to flaunt their religious
zeal, they refuse to see her and forgive her. You are the man for whom
she has sacrificed her home, her peace of mind, everything. Yet you
unblushingly go gadding to the Lebedieffs' every evening, for reasons
that are absolutely unmistakable!

B:
	No, never. Nor Dr. West, either. Never a word of it.

A:
	It's all about finding the balance.

B:
	[Glumly.] Sure, what else would it be?

A:
	Show it to me. I say fifty denarii.

B:
	Mr Ramsden: he used to say to me that he had met only one man
in the world who was the soul of honor, and that was Roebuck Ramsden.

A:
	That is surprising - I never thought about it like that before.

B:
	have taken to it lately. That’s true.

A:
	No, but I expect him. He has been here twice this afternoon
already to see me, but I was out.

B:
	August Philip Wulkow.
