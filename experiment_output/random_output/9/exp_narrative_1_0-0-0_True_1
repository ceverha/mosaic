A:
	We are lost in this cave. How much more battery power do we have left?

B:
	How could you, then--! Did not the child belong to me too?

A:
	In the same wrapper, addressed in the same hand. An hour ago, just as I
left the house. I suppose they haven't had time to look at the last
post here.

B:
	And surely, Mr. Bernick, you have not forgotten that
we--.(MARTHA comes in through the farther door to the left. Music is
heard in the distance, down the street.)

A:
	How much food do we have left? I'm beginning to worry.

B:
	And why wouldn't she, if she's a fine woman
itself?

A:
	[Smiling.]  It seems so.  Only wait!  This very

B:

A:
	Look! Is that a shaft of light I see?

B:
	[cutting him short by getting into the car] Off we go. First to
the bank for money; then to my rooms for my kit; then to your rooms for
your kit; then break the record from London to Dover or Folkestone; then
across the channel and away like mad to Marseilles, Gibraltar, Genoa,
any port from which we can sail to a Mahometan country where men are
protected from women.

A:
	Oh, how many they seem!... They had already run up from the suburbs of
the city when I came.... They are going a long way around....

B:
	It isn't anything to fret about. Some of us go soon, and
some travel the roads for their lifetime. What does it matter when we
are under the nettles if it was with a short rope or a long one we were
hanged?

A:
	Hooray! We've escaped!

B:
	I am
come between you.

A:
	It seems to me that the little fellow lacks education.

B:
	[Still occupied.]  And you, what do you possess?
