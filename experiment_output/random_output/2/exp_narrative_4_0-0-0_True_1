A:
	Let me get this straight. You did what?

B:
	I reely did have a little scare. That's a fac'.

A:
	Yes.

B:
	That is true enough, but still--

A:
	I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.

B:
	Lord bless you, I don't mean just exactly the same. But I
mean, if your Reverence had anything to be ashamed of in the eyes of the
world, as the saying goes. We menfolk oughtn't to judge a poor woman too
hardly, your Reverence.

A:
	Forget the anguish and remorse, I mean.

B:
	Yes: he's dead; and I'm done for. Now did you or did you not
write a letter to him to say that the most original moralist at present
in England, to the best of your knowledge, was Alfred Doolittle, a
common dustman.

A:
	Get out! GET OUT!

B:
	Listen. I've had ideas for a series of short
stories for the last couple of years--small town experiences, some of
them actual. I know that life--too darn well. I ought to be able to
write about it. And if I can sell one--to the _Post_, say--I'm sure
they'd take the others, too. And then--I should worry! It'd be easy
sailing. But you must promise to help--play critic for me--read them
and tell me where they're rotten.

A:
	I ain't namin' no names. You must ha' had some kind o' trouble with that
feller.

B:
	After he--? (Checks herself.)

A:
	I don't care. Don't speak to me again.

B:
	None whatever.

A:
	Oh, she didn't mean anything. Now be good again!

B:
	And you are one, of course?
