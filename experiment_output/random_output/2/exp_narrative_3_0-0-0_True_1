A:
	I can't believe you threw that ball over the fence. Now you're going to have to go into that dark, scary, spooky forest all by yourself!

B:
	That's a good lad [going].

A:
	[In a low voice.] You were so entrancingly beautiful, Rita.

B:
	[Takes of her things, and lays them on a chair beside the door.]
Yes, such a restless feeling came over me. I felt I must come out
to-day, and see how little Eyolf was getting on--and you too. [Lays the
portfolio on the table beside the sofa.] So I took the steamer, and here
I am.

A:
	Hurry up! You're making me worried. [hears scream] What was that? Hold on!

B:
	You, Senora, cannot come this way. You will have an
apotheosis. But you will be at the palace before us.

A:
	I loaned 'em to Karl Machnow.

B:
	[Looks half-mockingly at her.] People generally get used to the
inevitable.

A:
	It hurts so much, make it stop!

B:
	Not a bit of it. Dont you be afraid: Ive educated Bobby a bit: hes
not the mollycoddle he was when you had him in hand.

A:
	That very same day
My mother's estate grew cramped and narrow!
Through thicket, o'er highway, I hastened away
To the grove so pleasant with bow and with arrow!
There met I again the elf-maiden fair.

B:
	And then go--or no--stay there until the casket arrives. Do you
understand?

A:
	Be quiet. 

B:
	He said that himself! Actually said so!

A:
	What hateful wretch is this whose mighty thews
    Presage destruction to his adversaries?

B:
	Do you think that a father should allow ignorant and conceited
women to teach his daughter that he is a charlatan?
