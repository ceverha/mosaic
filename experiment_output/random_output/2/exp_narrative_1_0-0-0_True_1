A:
	We are lost in this cave. How much more battery power do we have left?

B:
	Enough, enough: Caesar has spoiled me for talking to weak
things like you. (She goes out. Pothinus, with a gesture of rage, is
following, when Ftatateeta enters and stops him.)

A:
	Yes, money and gunpowder; freedom and power; command
of life and command of death.

B:
	Yes, you understand the way to get on; that your worst enemy must allow.
Before the weaver has taken to bed, you're gettin' his coffin ready.

A:
	How much food do we have left? I'm beginning to worry.

B:
	And if I asked you now for a--? No!

A:
	I know. You feel that you could love anybody that offered--

B:
	Well, dear, there were other differences. I
really cannot bear an immoral man. I am not a Pharisee, I hope;
and I should not have minded his merely doing wrong things: we
are none of us perfect. But your father didn't exactly do wrong
things: he said them and thought them: that was what was so
dreadful. He really had a sort of religion of wrongness just as
one doesn't mind men practising immorality so long as they own
that they are in the wrong by preaching morality; so I couldn't
forgive Andrew for preaching immorality while he practised
morality. You would all have grown up without principles, without
any knowledge of right and wrong, if he had been in the house.
You know, my dear, your father was a very attractive man in some
ways. Children did not dislike him; and he took advantage of it
to put the wickedest ideas into their heads, and make them quite
unmanageable. I did not dislike him myself: very far from it; but
nothing can bridge over moral disagreement.

A:
	Look! Is that a shaft of light I see?

B:
	Gentlemen, my daughter. [They all bow]. We are very greatly
indebted to you, gentlemen, for so kindly indulging her whim. [The
dressing bell sounds. The Count looks at his watch]. Ah! The dressing
bell, gentlemen. As our play begins at nine, I have had to put forward
the dinner hour a little. May I shew you to your rooms? [He goes out,
followed by all the men, except Trotter, who, going last, is detained by
Fanny].

A:
	rU see her on board.

B:
	Man always falls into a trap, when his instinct leads him; but let us
veil his reason, let us change his character; we shall behold a sight
that will make us smile....

A:
	Hooray! We've escaped!

B:
	It’s no use, he won’t see us.

A:
	Am I dismissed now, your honour?

B:
	Kristin, you are a woman,--and my friend. Beware of this wretch.
