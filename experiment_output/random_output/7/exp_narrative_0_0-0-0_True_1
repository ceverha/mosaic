A:
	Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.

B:
	One might as well talk to a block of wood.

A:
	Make him! It's easy to say. He's in a queer state, Dad, I can
tell you! There's something torturing him besides her pain--

B:
	I mean a woman who would play the very devil if the
other women didnt keep her in pretty strict order. I dont approve of
democracy, because its rot; and Im against giving the vote to women
because Im not accustomed to it and therefore am able to see with an
unprejudiced eye what infernal nonsense it is. But I tell you plainly,
Lady Corinthia, that there is one game that I dislike more than either
Democracy or Votes For Women: and that is the game of Antony and
Cleopatra. If I must be ruled by women, let me have decent women and
not--well, not the other sort.

A:
	I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.

B:
	Oh, don't apologize. I was very high and mighty myself; but I've
come down since: oh, yes: I've been brought down. (She sits on the floor
beside his chair.)

A:
	Your mother's, you mean, and your grand mother's.

B:
	Moral: don't take rum.

A:
	You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.

B:
	And our secret business as well.

A:
	[Blinking his eyes and smiling.] So that they too might do a little
hunting on their own account, don't you see?

B:
	No.

A:
	With you dead, what keeps me alive?

B:
	[_Holding him back._] Wittig, Wittig! Don't lose your head!

A:
	No, indeed, you shall not. Of course you must come here just as
before. You know very well Torvald can't do without you.

B:
	Never mind, never mind, my dearest dear: it was my fault.
Come: you're safe now; and you're not hurt, are you? (He takes his arms
from her to see whether she can stand.) There: that's right, that's
right. If only you are not hurt, nothing else matters.
