A:
	Let me get this straight. You did what?

B:
	I told Karen that I couldn't take her to Prom anymore.

A:
	How?

B:
	Well... I sent her a text.

A:
	I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.

B:
	What's the big deal? I want to go with Chad now!

A:
	No.

B:
	No? Since when do you have a say in this?

A:
	Get out! GET OUT!

B:
	Fuck! Fine! You're being crazy!

A:
	[Pushing her father away brusquely, her eyes still holding
BURKE'S.] Keep out of this, you! [To BURKE--dully.] Well, ain't you got
the nerve to do it? Go ahead! I'll be thankful to you, honest. I'm sick
of the whole game.

B:
	You don't even like Chad! You said no when he asked you out last semester.

A:
	I don't care. Don't speak to me again.

B:
	Seriously? What did I even do to make you so mad?

A:
	I won't fight. If you beat me my wife would share my
humiliation. If I beat you, she would sympathize with you and loathe me
for my brutality.

B:
	oh my god KRISTIN!!! We are in HIGH SCHOOL!!!
