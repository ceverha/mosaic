A:
	Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.

B:
	Who? Oh, her? That's Dorice, she works in enterprise sales. She's a real oaf, if you ask me.

A:
	You better go upstairs a bit first.

B:
	Yeah, I heard there's donuts in the breakroom today. Guess that means somebody got fired...hah! Fine by me. Donuts are enough to boost my morale.

A:
	I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.

B:
	Man, you're really horned up today, aren't you? Save it for Dorice, I don't swing that way.

A:
	 I wonder whether they laugh at us when they are by
themselves!

B:
	I know I would.

A:
	You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.

B:
	I did it for the promotion, you oaf. Can't you see that?

A:
	You must be good to me and speak to me as though I were a human
being.

B:
	Alright, I'm sorry. That was uncalled for. I apologize for killing your cousin, but that's business!

A:
	With you dead, what keeps me alive?

B:
	That end of he year bonus. I hear the top salesman gets ten million dollars for Christmas.

A:
	Enormous, I hope: otherwise I shall require twenty-five
per cent.

B:
	The biggest, I promise you.
