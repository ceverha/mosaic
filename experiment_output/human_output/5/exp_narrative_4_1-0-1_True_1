A:
	Let me get this straight. You did what?

B:
	I may have accidentally crashed your car.

A:
	[Without looking up]. I don't know whether you are right or not,
but since we have quarreled, my strength has left me. Axel, will you
believe me,--I have never experienced before what I now feel--

B:
	I apologize for my actions, sir. I do wish us to stop quarrelling as soon as possible.

A:
	I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.

B:
	Fine. [Looks down at feet] What do you want to know?

A:
	Oh, I don't need any pressing. (Goes down into the garden.)

B:
	

A:
	Get out! GET OUT!

B:
	I thought you wanted to solve and discuss this issue! You are quite maddening at times.

A:
	Oh, you are sad, are you? I can understand that! Nicholas, let
me tell you something: won't you try to sing and laugh and scold as you
used to? Stay here, and we will drink some liqueur together, and laugh,
and chase away this sadness of yours in no time. Shall I sing to you? Or
shall we sit in your study in the twilight as we used to, while you tell
me about your sadness? I can read such suffering in your eyes! Let
me look into them and weep, and our hearts will both be lighter. [She
laughs and cries at once] Or is it really true that the flowers return
with every spring, but lost happiness never returns? Oh, is it? Well, go
then, go!

B:
	I do not understand you most days. Should we discuss thi issue or will you forever be ths difficult. Either way, I'm leaving.

A:
	I don't care. Don't speak to me again.

B:
	FINE! I thought you cared for me and you is all.

A:
	He is very nice; very nice indeed.  But I canâ€™t stand the
American young lady.

B:
	Me either. She is the only person who manages to make me feel upset about my misfortune.
