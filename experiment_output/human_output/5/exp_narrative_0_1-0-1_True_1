A:
	Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.

B:
	She is the daughter of our mortal enemy. I want to speak to her and strangle her mother.

A:
	[_Strongly_.]  Oh, fight in any caseâ€”in any case.

B:
	Yes, you are right. I should fight this urge to fight.

A:
	I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.

B:
	Do you really?

A:
	Ah, naturally you can't appreciate it as keenly as I.
You have lived all your life in these surroundings, and your
impressions have been blunted. But I, who have been buried all these
years in my little corner up north, almost without ever seeing a
stranger who might bring new ideas with him--well, in my case it has
just the same effect as if I had been transported into the middle of a
crowded city.

B:
	So you do love me?

A:
	You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.

B:
	How do you know I killed your cousin? I do not plan on leaving, please do not die.

A:
	Then where is the burning desire for me that you fought and battled
against when I stood freely forth before you as the woman arisen from
the dead?

B:
	I still feel that desire! I want to be with you in any space and time!

A:
	With you dead, what keeps me alive?

B:
	I am not dead! But if I was, let your love for my corpse keep you alive.

A:
	What does this mean?

B:
	It means you should love me, whether I am dead or alive. And that love you have for me should keep you alive until the end of time.
