A:
	I can't believe you threw that ball over the fence. Now you're going to have to go into that dark, scary, spooky forest all by yourself!

B:
	(grabbing hand) not if you come with me!

A:
	How the devil do I know what's to become of you? What does it
matter what becomes of you?

B:
	It matters because we are friends, and what becomes of me must affect you in some way!

A:
	Hurry up! You're making me worried. [hears scream] What was that? Hold on!

B:
	Perhaps we don't actually need the ball...

A:
	No, I don't know as you do. But I didn't go to war.

B:
	War is a trivial thing comapared to the dangers involved with retrieving that ball!

A:
	It hurts so much, make it stop!

B:
	Only if you come with me can we make it stop!

A:
	I woke him yesterday. He was angry with me, he could not get to the
heart of the command.

B:
	[gestures to fence] If you come with me, maybe he won't be angry anymore.

A:
	Be quiet. 

B:
	Why should I be quiet? You're the one who started this conversation!

A:
	I believe you do feel thoroughly at home with us.

B:
	Maybe I do, but that does not solve the problem of the ball over the fence!
