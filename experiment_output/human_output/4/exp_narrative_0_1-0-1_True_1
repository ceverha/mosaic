A:
	Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.

B:
	You think she's beautiful? Her teeth are covered in mustard

A:
	 Pity your father didnt give your thin skin a jolly good
lacing with a cane--!

B:
	Pity your father didn't give you a single ounce of wit

A:
	I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.

B:
	Good god, are you drunk?

A:
	I have only told you half of them as yet, Miss Mabel!

B:
	Tell me more, I'm soooooooo curious

A:
	You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.

B:
	Yes, it was I. I drove the knife into his neck. Want more details?

A:
	[Darkly.] And why did you hold your hand?

B:
	Because the only person I have is myself

A:
	With you dead, what keeps me alive?

B:
	Nothing. That's the point. I want you to suffer.

A:
	But that's what you're doing when you conjure up this ghost of
a happiness that is now forever buried.

B:
	Exactly. Do you remember forever ago? When you really hurt me? i've been trying to hurt you even more since then
