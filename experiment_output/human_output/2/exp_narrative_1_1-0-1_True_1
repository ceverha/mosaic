A:
	We are lost in this cave. How much more battery power do we have left?

B:
	Are we talking about the battery life of the flashlight or my phone?

A:
	â€™Faith, the pair of you together is better than Hector fighting before
Troy!

B:
	Is that a reference to the Iliad? You know I don't know anything about Homer Simpson.

A:
	How much food do we have left? I'm beginning to worry.

B:
	I have two loaves of bread and one bag of trail mix, minus the M&Ms. (Embarrased) I ate those on the drive to the park.

A:
	DUDGEON. That's no answer to make to me, sir. Go and do as you're
told. (Christy turns sullenly to obey.) Stop: take down that shutter
before you go, and let the daylight in: you can't expect me to do all
the heavy work of the house with a great heavy lout like you idling
about.

B:
	Wait, why are we talking about house work? I thought we were stuck together in a cave?

A:
	Look! Is that a shaft of light I see?

B:
	Oh boy, I hope so.

A:
	I know very well what you meant. The impudence!

B:
	I'm not calling you a boy. 'Oh boy' is just an expression.

A:
	Hooray! We've escaped!

B:
	(Muttering to herself) And all while debating the expression "oh boy"[D.

A:
	Juan!

B:
	Pedro!
