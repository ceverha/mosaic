JACK:
	Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.

JILL:
	Beau--! Oho! Here's a chance for Nora! and for me!
[Calling] Hodson.

JACK:
	I cannot spend the night in a strange man's
room.

JILL:
	I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.

JACK:
	Is that the way to talk to a father? Your marriage was
a most disastrous imprudence. It gave you habits that are absolutely
beyond your means--I mean beyond my means: you have no means. Why did
you not marry Matthews: the best curate I ever had?

JILL:
	How do you suppose I could have known it?

JACK:
	You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.

JILL:
	Good night, then, Captain. I'm afraid. I can be of no further
use in this case.

JACK:
	I know you will. (As he is going out) Oh! one word, Mr.
Rankin. (He comes back.) The Cadi didn't know that Captain Brassbound
was Sir Howard's nephew, did he?

JILL:
	With you dead, what keeps me alive?

JACK:
	I thought he was travelling with a theatrical company.

JILL:
	Yes, that was the worst thing of the lot.
