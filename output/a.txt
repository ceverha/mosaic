JACK:
	We are lost in this cave.

JILL:
	Yes.

JACK:
	And he is not angry.

JILL:
	No, I’m angry with myself.

JACK:
	How much more battery power do we have left?

JILL:
	He had nothing of his own. His money was the money I
brought him as my marriage portion. It was for me to deal with my own
money and my own son. He dare not have done it if I had been with him;
and well he knew it. That was why he stole away like a thief to take
advantage of the law to rob me by making a new will behind my back. The
more shame on you, Mr. Anderson,--you, a minister of the gospel--to act
as his accomplice in such a crime.

JACK:
	Well, of your disappointment, if you can find it in your
heart to think that the better word.

JILL:
	My heart! My heart! And since when, pray, have you begun
to hold up our hearts as trustworthy guides for us?

JACK:
	We have four hours for batteries.

JILL:
	What, three or four years? Not before?

JACK:
	What, three or four years? Not before?

JILL:
	What, three or four years? Not before?

JACK:
	How much food do we have left?

JILL:
	All that’s irrelevant.

JACK:
	No, M. le président, it ought to be known here how the
State, which preaches increase of the population, treats its employés
when they have children.

JILL:
	 [_furious_] You have no right to speak. [_To the schoolmistress_]
Have you anything more to say?

JACK:
	Don't worry about that, we can escape.

JILL:
	 really cant leave it at that, sir. I assure you Ive no
objection to young Mr Gilbey's going to prison. You may do six months
yourself, sir, and welcome, without a word of remonstrance from me. I'm
leaving solely because my brother, who has suffered a bereavement, and
feels lonely, begs me to spend a few months with him until he gets over
it.

JACK:
	And is he to keep you all that time? or are you to spend your
savings in comforting him? Have some sense, man: how can you afford such
things?

JILL:
	My brother can afford to keep me, sir. The truth is, he objects
to my being in service.

JACK:
	Look! Is that a shaft of light I see?

JILL:
	That’s better. [_They talk on_].

JACK:
	If the river rises another couple of inches down will
come four hundred feet of that wall.

JILL:
	It’s not as bad as that.

JACK:
	Hooray! We're free!

JILL:
	 sent her away.

JACK:
	Ah!

JILL:
	We had a most delightful trip in the hills; and Captain
Brassbound's men could not have been nicer--I must say that for
them--until we saw a tribe of Arabs--such nice looking men!--and then
the poor things were frightened.
