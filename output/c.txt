JACK:
	Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.

JILL:
	Beau--! Oho! Here's a chance for Nora! and for me!
[Calling] Hodson.

JACK:
	 [appearing at the bedroom door]. Did you call, sir?

JILL:
	I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.

JACK:
	 [bitingly] The same feeling, Frank, that brought your father to my
mother’s feet. Is that it?

JILL:
	 [so revolted that he slips off the table for a moment] I very
strongly object, Viv, to have my feelings compared to any which the
Reverend Samuel is capable of harboring; and I object still more to a
comparison of you to your mother. [Resuming his perch] Besides, I don’t
believe the story. I have taxed my father with it, and obtained from him
what I consider tantamount to a denial.

JACK:
	You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.

JILL:
	Proceed, madame.

JACK:
	Have you ever considered [_she hesitates_] what you
would give your daughter?

JILL:
	With you dead, what keeps me alive?

JACK:
	And will all the men call me their dear Ana?

JILL:
	No. That was a slip of the tongue. I beg your pardon.
