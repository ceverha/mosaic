JACK:
	Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.

JILL:
	Beau--! Oho! Here's a chance for Nora! and for me!
[Calling] Hodson.

JACK:
	 [patting her]. Yes, yes, of course, Nora Creena, Nora
acushla [he makes cush rhyme to plush].

JILL:
	I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.

JACK:
	 [looking at him with a faint impulse of pity] Tavy, my dear, you
are a nice creature--a good boy.

JILL:
	My dear Praddy: you forget that I have to live with the governor.
When two people live together--it don’t matter whether theyre father and
son or husband and wife or brother and sister--they can’t keep up the
polite humbug thats so easy for ten minutes on an afternoon call.
Now the governor, who unites to many admirable domestic qualities the
irresoluteness of a sheep and the pompousness and aggressiveness of a
jackass--

JACK:
	You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.

JILL:
	This is not the first time I have found myself in this
situation, and I must begin by telling you that parents who have
refused to be guided by my advice have invariably repented of it most
bitterly.

JACK:
	No, Henry. I will do nothing improper, nothing dishonorable. [She
sits down plump on the stool and looks inflexible].

JILL:
	With you dead, what keeps me alive?

JACK:
	Everybody else is making sacrifices without a thought of self;
and you--

JILL:
	 recognize the Crofts philosophy of life, mother. I heard it all
from him that day at the Gardners’.
