JACK:
	We are lost in this cave.

JILL:
	Yes.

JACK:
	It also makes everybody pretend not to believe it.  Mrs
Tarleton:  youre not playing the game.

JILL:
	How much more battery power do we have left?

JACK:
	He had nothing of his own. His money was the money I
brought him as my marriage portion. It was for me to deal with my own
money and my own son. He dare not have done it if I had been with him;
and well he knew it. That was why he stole away like a thief to take
advantage of the law to rob me by making a new will behind my back. The
more shame on you, Mr. Anderson,--you, a minister of the gospel--to act
as his accomplice in such a crime.

JILL:
	Henry: don't be absurd. If you really want to know where
Eliza is, she is upstairs.

JACK:
	We have four hours for batteries.

JILL:
	What, three or four years? Not before?

JACK:
	No, no. For pity’s sake! You can cure me before that.

JILL:
	How much food do we have left?

JACK:
	All that’s irrelevant.

JILL:
	Yes, ma’am.

JACK:
	Don't worry about that, we can escape.

JILL:
	 really cant leave it at that, sir. I assure you Ive no
objection to young Mr Gilbey's going to prison. You may do six months
yourself, sir, and welcome, without a word of remonstrance from me. I'm
leaving solely because my brother, who has suffered a bereavement, and
feels lonely, begs me to spend a few months with him until he gets over
it.

JACK:
	Most certainly. Do you suppose I will let that woman think I am
afraid to meet her? (Charteris sinks on a chair with a prolonged
groan.) Come: don't be silly: you'll not overtake the Colonel if you
delay any longer.

JILL:
	Look! Is that a shaft of light I see?

JACK:
	That’s better. [_They talk on_].

JILL:
	Oh! scandalmongering?

JACK:
	Hooray! We're free!

JILL:
	 sent her away.

JACK:
	Nonsense, man. You are talking to a woman of 77 now. If you had had
the chance, you would have run away from me too--if I had let you. You
would not have found it so easy with me as with some of the others. If
men will not be faithful to their home and their duties, they must be
made to be. I daresay you all want to marry lovely incarnations of music
and painting and poetry. Well, you can't have them, because they
don't exist. If flesh and blood is not good enough for you you must
go without: that's all. Women have to put up with flesh-and-blood
husbands--and little enough of that too, sometimes; and you will have to
put up with flesh-and-blood wives. The Devil looks dubious. The Statue
makes a wry face. I see you don't like that, any of you; but it's true,
for all that; so if you don't like it you can lump it.
