JACK:
	We are lost in this cave.

JILL:
	Help! How are we going to escape from here?

JACK:
	 will come and put you on your way.

JILL:
	But which way is the right way to go?

JACK:
	Victawriar Pork station. There's a city train at 12.25.

JILL:
	How much more battery power do we have left?

JACK:
	Not much. Only a few more hours then we will be stuck in the dark.

JILL:
	 [sighing] Ah! you have not yet lost the sense of time. One
soon does, in eternity.

JACK:
	You are right. We will be stuck in here forever. I do not want to die!

JILL:
	Come—into my arms. Put your head on my shoulder as you used when
you were little. There now, tell me what the trouble is. [_Speaking
low_]. My darling—my little darling—I’m afraid you’re most unhappy. Try
and think that it’s mother.

JACK:
	We have four hours for batteries.

JILL:
	Perhaps there is still hope. Do you remember how we got here?

JACK:
	Sarah! That is a lie! Say what you want, but don't insult me
with a lie!

JILL:
	Get a hold of yourself! You know that Sarah is not my name.

JACK:
	 [thunderstruck] You don't tell me so!

JILL:
	How much food do we have left?

JACK:
	That is not a problem. I brought enough meat and bread to feed a small family.

JILL:
	What do you go encouraging that young pup for?

JACK:
	We are both losing our wits. We need to get out of here, fast.

JILL:
	You should have thought of that before you attacked a lady
with a dastardly slander.  I'm waiting for your decision.  I'm rather
in a hurry, please.

JACK:
	Don't worry about that, we can escape.

JILL:
	What do you mean? How can we escape?

JACK:
	 wonder are you really a clever man!

JILL:
	Do not insult me. We need to work together.

JACK:
	He has not stolen our affection from you. It is only
curiosity.

JILL:
	Look! Is that a shaft of light I see?

JACK:
	Yes! We are saved!

JILL:
	 don't know. Ask Zuzu.

JACK:
	Hurry! The lights are growing dim.

JILL:
	 [looking up at the house]. It's Mr Hushabye turning on
all the lights in the house and tearing down the curtains.

JACK:
	Hooray! We're free!

JILL:
	I never want to see you again. Do not speak to me.

JACK:
	Straker knew even that. He learnt it at the Polytechnic,
probably. Well, what about Ann? Have you proposed to her?

JILL:
	Get away from me.

JACK:
	No: right to get rid of you? I should be a fool not to. Isn’t that
so?
