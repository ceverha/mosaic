A:
	Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.

B:
	Oh my god, she looks amazing. She looks like a young Maggie Smith. I'd like to get McGonag-ALL up in that. Should I go talk to her?

A:
	 Oh yes, if there had only been anything for me to do, any
place for me to go, anything I wanted to read.

B:
	Okay, you're right. You saw her first. You've got dibs. What are you going to say to her?

A:
	I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.

B:
	Mmmm, I like it. Coming on a little strong, maybe, but you've got to make an impact with a girl like that. [A starts to walk toward the smokin' hot superbabe but gets nervous and returns to B.

A:
	Everything changes. One must have courage.

B:
	[B grabs a drink from the bar and hands it to A.] How about a little liquid courage?

A:
	You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.

B:
	[B slaps A across the face.] Pull yourself together. You're not talking sense. Now, take a deep breath. [A does.] And go talk to her.

A:
	How can you ask that? I love you because it is not in you to stop.

B:
	Wait, you mean...? Bro? You love me?

A:
	With you dead, what keeps me alive?

B:
	Oh my god, then... All our playful misogyny was just some filmy facade designed to hide our deep homoerotic longing for one another? Chad, I can't believe this! You know what this means?

A:
	There was your mistake.  There was your error.  The
error all women commit.  Why can’t you women love us, faults and all?
Why do you place us on monstrous pedestals?  We have all feet of clay,
women as well as men; but when we men love women, we love them knowing
their weaknesses, their follies, their imperfections, love them all the
more, it may be, for that reason.  It is not the perfect, but the
imperfect, who have need of love.  It is when we are wounded by our own
hands, or by the hands of others, that love should come to cure us—else
what use is love at all?  All sins, except a sin against itself, Love
should forgive.  All lives, save loveless lives, true Love should pardon.
A man’s love is like that.  It is wider, larger, more human than a
woman’s.  Women think that they are making ideals of men.  What they are
making of us are false idols merely.  You made your false idol of me, and
I had not the courage to come down, show you my wounds, tell you my
weaknesses.  I was afraid that I might lose your love, as I have lost it
now.  And so, last night you ruined my life for me—yes, ruined it!  What
this woman asked of me was nothing compared to what she offered to me.
She offered security, peace, stability.  The sin of my youth, that I had
thought was buried, rose up in front of me, hideous, horrible, with its
hands at my throat.  I could have killed it for ever, sent it back into
its tomb, destroyed its record, burned the one witness against me.  You
prevented me.  No one but you, you know it.  And now what is there before
me but public disgrace, ruin, terrible shame, the mockery of the world, a
lonely dishonoured life, a lonely dishonoured death, it may be, some day?
Let women make no more ideals of men! let them not put them on alters and
bow before them, or they may ruin other lives as completely as you—you
whom I have so wildly loved—have ruined mine!

B:
	[B pulls A into a deep, passionate kiss, stopping his mouth. Their lips separate slowly; their eyes find something precious, fragile, hidden in each other. Then, B finds the courage to speak.] I love you too, bro. Let's get out of here.
