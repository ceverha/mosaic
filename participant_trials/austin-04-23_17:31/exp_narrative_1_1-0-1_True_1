A:
	We are lost in this cave. How much more battery power do we have left?

B:
	[The flashlight shuts off. Darkness.] Does that answer your question? Here, feel around for something to help orient us.

A:
	Pretending to be asleep! Do you think if I was only pretending
that I'd have sprawled there helpless, and listened to such unfairness,
such lies, such injustice and plotting and backbiting and slandering of
me, if I could have up and told you what I thought of you! I wonder I
didn't burst.

B:
	Now's not the time to fight. We need to get to safety. I'm not happy to be stuck with you either.

A:
	How much food do we have left? I'm beginning to worry.

B:
	Oh, you're BEGINNING to worry? [B feels around their knapsack.] A couple granola bars, some trail mix, and... [B produces a purring object.] We've got Mr. Sniffles.

A:
	Do you sail soon, Captain Horster?

B:
	For the last time, we voted on it, and the cat's name is Sniffles! Hey, cats have great night vision. Maybe he can help guide us out of this dark cave.

A:
	Look! Is that a shaft of light I see?

B:
	[B returns Mr. Sniffles to the knapsack.] You're off the hook this time, fuzzy boy. Let's start clearing away some of this dirt and these rocks.

A:
	And why wouldn't they tell me that? Am I not one of
yourselves?

B:
	I don't think there's any reason to assume they wanted us to get stuck down here. If we call for help, maybe they'll hear us and come to our rescue. HEY! ANYONE THERE? WE'RE TRAPPED IN THE CAVE!

A:
	Hooray! We've escaped!

B:
	[Hands from the other side start clearing away dirt and rocks.] Thank goodness. Now I don't have to die next to you, you big dweeb.

A:
	[also almost in tears, but of vexation] Oh don't be an idiot,
Tavy. Hector's about as fit to become a workman as you are.

B:
	[Produces a barking object from their knapsack.] Well, I don't think that's very nice at all, do you, Hector? No you don't. No you don't. Such a good boy.
