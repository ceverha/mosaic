Shit. Wait, you mean, you're not coming with me?
<===>
I take it myself, you know, when I feel run down.
Good-bye. You dont mind my calling, do you? Just to congratulate you.
I think I see the ball. I'm going to go grab it!
<===>
No, I don't. But now I am going to try. I am going to see if I can
make out who is right, the world or I.
I'm serious! Get over here!
<===>
Oh! I think I'm getting on famously. And by next year, if I
can go south--
[Those last words emanate from the monster. It's clear that B's fallen into a trap. A is the monster.] Don't do this, please. I only wanted my ball back. I don't want to die.

[_Laughs bitterly._] It's true enough--no one knows what'll be the end of
it. You may be right yet. [_Bursts out in fury._] But if it does come to
that, I know who I've got to thank for it, who it is that's blabbed to
the manufacturers an' all the gentlemen round, an' blackened my character
to that extent that they never give me a hand's turn of work to do--an'
set the peasants an' the millers against me, so that I'm often a whole
week without a horse to shoe or a wheel to put a tyre on. I know who's
done it. I once pulled the damned brute off his horse, because he was
givin' a little stupid boy the most awful flogging for stealin' a few
unripe pears. But I tell you this, Kutsche, and you know me--if you get
me put into prison, you may make your own will. If I hears as much as a
whisper of it. I'll take the first thing as comes handy, whether it's a
horseshoe or a hammer, a wheel-spoke or a pail; I'll get hold of you if
I've to drag you out of bed from beside your wife, and I'll beat in your
brains, as sure as my name's Wittig.
