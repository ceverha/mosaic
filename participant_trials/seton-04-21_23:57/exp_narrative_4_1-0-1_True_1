A:
	Let me get this straight. You did what?

B:
	I took my mom's car out for a spin and went to CVS. Then I walked outside and there was a guy standing by my car holding flowers. Longstory short, this guy that my mom is having an affair with recognized her car in the parking lot and now my parents are probably going to get divorced. Should I tell my sister?

A:
	Hesione, is it possible that you don't know me?

B:
	Ah, I see what you are trying to do.  You want me to have sympathy for my mom. Yeah, I know. I will never know every aspect of your life of my mom's but that doesn't mean I'll let her get away with this. 

A:
	I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.

B:
	THATS WHAT I AM SAYING

A:
	Is it true that you're working down at Nentwich's now?

B:
	Yeah, I started work there last week with my sister. She is there now, I think we should go tell her about all this.

A:
	Get out! GET OUT!

B:
	You can't come with?

A:
	Love me, be merciful! I am honest now, I believe, otherwise I
would never humiliate myself as--as I am doing now, before a man.

B:
	Hahahaha that's probably what my mom will say to my dad after he find out about the affair.... Should i call him now?

A:
	I don't care. Don't speak to me again.

B:
	ugh quit the roleplaying. The fight is going to happen soon, I am sure of it. I'll let you know what actually happens when it does. Now, I gotta get to Nentwich.

A:
	I don't see your reserve, Mr. Doubleday !

B:
	Alright, enough with this... Can I borrow your car?
