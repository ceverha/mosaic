I took my mom's car out for a spin and went to CVS. Then I walked outside and there was a guy standing by my car holding flowers. Longstory short, this guy that my mom is having an affair with recognized her car in the parking lot and now my parents are probably going to get divorced. Should I tell my sister?
<===>
Ellie, my darling, my pettikins [kissing her], how long
have you been here? I've been at home all the time: I was putting
flowers and things in your room; and when I just sat down for a moment
to try how comfortable the armchair was I went off to sleep. Papa woke
me and told me you were here. Fancy your finding no one, and being
neglected and abandoned. [Kissing her again]. My poor love! [She
deposits Ellie on the sofa. Meanwhile Ariadne has left the table and
come over to claim her share of attention]. Oh! you've brought someone
with you. Introduce me.
THATS WHAT I AM SAYING
<===>
Yes, that's just what I am.
You can't come with?
<===>
No, I cannot. You can't draw me to you as you used to do.
ugh quit the roleplaying. The fight is going to happen soon, I am sure of it. I'll let you know what actually happens when it does. Now, I gotta get to Nentwich.
<===>
I shall try to do so presently ; but, before I begin, let 
me say this one thing, which was really, I think, the 
idea that made me break my vow ! I want you to 
understand my reserve.
