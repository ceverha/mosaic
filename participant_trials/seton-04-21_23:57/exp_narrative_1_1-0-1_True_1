A:
	We are lost in this cave. How much more battery power do we have left?

B:
	mine says we have got only 25 minitues

A:
	Oh, Betty, you have won me. It was
through Lona that I first learned really to know you. But now let Olaf
come to me.

B:
	Betty? Only my mom calls me that...

A:
	How much food do we have left? I'm beginning to worry.

B:
	I have two chocolate bars and a twinkie. what's in your pack?

A:
	If we could any way have a bit o' meat on Sundays and holidays, instead
o' never seein' the sight of it from year's end to year's end! Now we'll
have to wait till another poor little dog finds its way into the house
like this one did four weeks gone by--an' that's not likely to happen
soon again.

B:
	there is a pile of dog bones at the pack of the cave. Come on, lets go

A:
	Look! Is that a shaft of light I see?

B:
	Yes! in the distance

A:
	Then come to Paris !

B:
	I'll join you in going to the city as soon as we get out of here. I want a crepe

A:
	Hooray! We've escaped!

B:
	IM HUNGRY and all my chocolate bars have melted 

A:
	I thought you was goin' to square your account.

B:
	I know, I know. I owe you some. I'll buy you the finest chocolate in return when we get to paris
