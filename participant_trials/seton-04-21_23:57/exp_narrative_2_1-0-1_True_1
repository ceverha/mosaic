A:
	How are you doing today? I haven't seen you in a while.

B:
	you know...I have been better. Christopher had a bit of an accident last night and I couldn't get any sleep. 

A:
	They would hardly have left you in your lodgings with no
one to look after you. [_Pause_]. What a strange idea it was of yours
to go off and live by yourself like that!

B:
	What do you mean strange?

A:
	Really? Now that's hard to believe. 

B:
	what? is it so hard to believe that I don't regret my decision to leave or find it strange?

A:
	So you would rather stay at home here, and let life pass you
by?

B:
	No, that's never been my goal. I want to see the world, grow as an individual. Christopher is keeping me down. 

A:
	It's all about finding the balance.

B:
	It was all about balance... but now, I'm moving on, searching for solace elsewhere. 

A:
	[Turning away from him with a short laugh--uneasily.] Why, sure.
Why not?

B:
	EXACTLY! WHY NOT! I'm headed to the airport to catch the transatlantic flight. Wanna join?

A:
	That is surprising - I never thought about it like that before.

B:
	What? that you can just pick up and leave anytime you want? You can, and it is liberating. 

A:
	Oh, yes, I should love to go to town, away from here, anywhere.
If I can only see you sometimes--often. Oh, it is so gloomy and awful in
there all the time, like a winter night, but when you come home Father,
it is like a morning in spring when they take off the double windows.

B:
	Son. I know that christopher and I's relationship had driven you away, but he's the past. In my middle age I have become sick of investing my time into people who do not matter to me. You matter to me, that why I insist you move with me. Pack your bags boy!
