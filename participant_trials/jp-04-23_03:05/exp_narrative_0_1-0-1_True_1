A:
	Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.

B:
	That is a six year old girl.

A:
	Yes, don't you think so?

B:
	I do think so, because that's my daughter.

A:
	I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.

B:
	I love you too.

A:
	You.

B:
	You.

A:
	You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.

B:
	You must hold on. You're my only love. I can get past the whole cousin thing. It can just be you and my six year old daughter you have a creepy crush on living in the mountains together. Alone.

A:
	Now it is the king's blood talking. Splendid, Miss Julie! Only
keep the miller in his sack.

B:
	God I hate that girl Julie.

A:
	With you dead, what keeps me alive?

B:
	Drink the juice with me

A:
	Thank you, very much. I am only a common man--

B:
	But you're a woman.
