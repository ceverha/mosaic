A:
	How are you doing today? I haven't seen you in a while.

B:
	It's been a rough couple of weeks.

A:
	If they're a short
space there aren't many the like of you.
Wasn't there a queen in Tara had to walk out
every morning till she'd meet a stranger and
see the flame of courtship leaping up within
his eye?  Tell me now, (_leaning towards her_)
are you well pleased that length with the same
man snorting next you at the dawn of day?

B:
	I am not well pleased as you can see.

A:
	Really? Now that's hard to believe. 

B:
	What makes you think that?

A:
	Hasn't she paid a visit to the confectioner's?

B:
	She has not yet gone.

A:
	It's all about finding the balance.

B:
	I couldn't agree with you more.

A:
	Yes, it was only the natural thing to do. (ALFRED comes forward
and bows respectfully to SVAVA. She bows slightly, but without looking
at him. He steps back again.)

B:
	How are you doing today? I forgot to ask.

A:
	That is surprising - I never thought about it like that before.

B:
	So you're doing well then?

A:
	Go where?

B:
	Maybe we can go to the park.
