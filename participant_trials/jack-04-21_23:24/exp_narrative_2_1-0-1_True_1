A:
	How are you doing today? I haven't seen you in a while.

B:
	I am doing well.

A:
	Going on a journey, if I am not mistaken?

B:
	Perhaps. I haven't decided yet.

A:
	Really? Now that's hard to believe. 

B:
	Well I can be quite indecisive if left to my own devices.

A:
	No, no, no, darling: how could you tire me? [She lifts him
so that he lies on her bosom].

B:
	[stands up] I wish you wouldn't do that.

A:
	It's all about finding the balance.

B:
	I guess you're right. But please respect me.

A:
	No, I didn't: I adored you. (She rises quickly and turns her
back on him.) And you can never take that moment away from me. So now I
don't care what happens. (He comes down the room addressing a cheerful
explanation to nobody in particular.) I'm perfectly aware that I'm
talking nonsense. I can't help it. (To Mrs. Clandon.) I love Gloria; and
there's an end of it.

B:
	Well that is a bunch of nonsense.

A:
	That is surprising - I never thought about it like that before.

B:
	Yeah! you need to get a grip.

A:
	Who's goin to give it to me? You, props.

B:
	Back off!
