A:
	How are you doing today? I haven't seen you in a while.

B:
	Ooowie, let me tell you. I've had quite the week. Just yesterday, I ran into Katherine and she had me run all around town to pick up stuff for her cousin's birthday party. Balloons, cakes, clowns...I'm talkin the whole shebang! Barely left me any time to tend to my shoe shining business

A:
	Be quick. If you are away five minutes, it will seem
five hours. (Raina runs to the top of the steps and turns there
to exchange a look with him and wave him a kiss with both hands.
He looks after her with emotion for a moment, then turns slowly
away, his face radiant with the exultation of the scene which
has just passed. The movement shifts his field of vision, into
the corner of which there now comes the tail of Louka's double
apron. His eye gleams at once. He takes a stealthy look at her,
and begins to twirl his moustache nervously, with his left hand
akimbo on his hip. Finally, striking the ground with his heels
in something of a cavalry swagger, he strolls over to the left
of the table, opposite her, and says) Louka: do you know what
the higher love is?

B:
	Well sweetie, I can only imagine what you want me to say. Sure, I may drone on for a while about love and romanance and destiny, and I'm sure you'd have a witty response back to me. But at the end of the day, nothing stands in between me and my shoe shining business...and that's that!

A:
	Really? Now that's hard to believe. 

B:
	Yeah, I guess you're right. You've always been a real charmer. Maybe I could fall for one of your games one more time...(blinks seductively)

A:
	Well, if it were really agony, would you ask for more of it?

B:
	There he goes with his witty quips! You always know how to charm me. Alright, let me close up the shop and we can go grab a drink?

A:
	It's all about finding the balance.

B:
	The only balance I'll be seeing today is negative...I was barely open for 3 hours today! 2 customers and they barely tipped me a dime. Let's go.

A:
	Some one would need to go to Berlin an' tell the King how hard put to it
we are.

B:
	No kidding. My son is all upset because I expect him to spend his summer at the shop instead of frolicking in France like a fa...oh sorry, I almost got carried away. Yeah, damn the King!

A:
	That is surprising - I never thought about it like that before.

B:
	I wish I hadn't

A:
	But supposing I were the cat, who would then be the mouse?

B:
	Higher love, of course!
