A:
	Let me get this straight. You did what?

B:
	Listen man...I'm not proud of it. But it needed to be done. And it's over anyways. We have the money now.

A:
	 Hear, hear!

B:
	Now let's go find that lunatic and take him down.

A:
	I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.

B:
	Really?? Right now? Fine! Yes, I did shoot your sister. But she got in the way of the mission, and it couldn't be helped.

A:
	[Sadly] You have found your way, you know where you are
going, but I am still groping in a chaos of phantoms and dreams, not
knowing whom and what end I am serving by it all. I do not believe in
anything, and I do not know what my calling is.

B:
	Right now, your calling is to find and take down Lucian. Once he's dead, you can worry about your calling (scoffs)

A:
	Get out! GET OUT!

B:
	Oh SHIT! It's Lucian! Looks like he found us first. I'm out of here. Quick! Down the ladder.

A:
	Quite a place to look for a book.

B:
	Yeah, who would have thought that this sewer was right below the last standing Barnes & Nobles left.

A:
	I don't care. Don't speak to me again.

B:
	Fine by me.

A:
	That's low of you, mother John, that you wants to make me out so bad now.
Then I won't be careful neither not to let nothin' out! You know all
right that I carried the young lady's child down here an' put it in the
nice, clean bed. I c'n swear to that! I c'n take my oath on that!

B:
	Take your oath to hell. Let's go.
