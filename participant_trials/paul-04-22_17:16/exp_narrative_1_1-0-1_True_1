A:
	We are lost in this cave. How much more battery power do we have left?

B:
	I just turned on low power mode. Maybe 10 more minutes?

A:
	Mother!

B:
	Well I didn't know that playing Candy Crush would drain the battery so much.

A:
	How much food do we have left? I'm beginning to worry.

B:
	[with guilt] Half a Snickers and a few Wheat Thins.

A:
	I think we may, now.

B:
	May eat them? Well if it's alright with you. [begins eating]

A:
	Look! Is that a shaft of light I see?

B:
	[mouth full] Yes!

A:
	I have not read the paper.

B:
	Well at least we got out of this cave alive. Your grades are the last thing on my mind.

A:
	Hooray! We've escaped!

B:
	Let me call a Lyft.

A:
	(She holds the match for him to light his cigar.) And
now goodbye!

B:
	See ya. Worst Easter ever!
