B:
	Impossible! He shouldn't have been able to make it to the control room so quickly.

A:
	I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.

B:
	You're preaching to the choir. Grab that axe!

A:
	That shall not come to pass; verily it shall not.

B:
	Now is not the time to be preaching your pacifist drivel!

A:
	Get out! GET OUT!

B:
	You'll handle this then? Godspeed. [runs]

A:
	Hush.

B:
	[looks back] You're a good man.

A:
	I don't care. Don't speak to me again.

B:
	[turns and runs]

A:
	Is there really any danger for Howard?

B:
	[out of breath] I'm not sure. He was a world-class kickboxer before going pacifist.
