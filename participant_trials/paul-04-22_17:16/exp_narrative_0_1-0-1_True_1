A:
	Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.

B:
	That's my sister. You keep your eyes off her.

A:
	Night after night I have heard her
steps in there.  I have heard her whispering and moaning like a
soul in pain.  And what says the song----  Ah, now I know!  Now
I know that----

B:
	Yeah, doctor says she has a terrible case of IBS.

A:
	I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.

B:
	Don't talk to her!

A:
	Oh! indeed. So I suppose it was you. (To ELLIDA.) I hear a
stranger has been to the house and asked for you?

B:
	That was probably our uncle David. How did you even hear that?

A:
	You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.

B:
	Brad is dead?

A:
	No, he may yet cone back to life, but to what an awakening we
cannot tell.

B:
	I'm sorry to hear that.

A:
	With you dead, what keeps me alive?

B:
	Well he could come back to life. Also when did you get so close to Ellida?

A:
	[Seizes him by the arm.] Oswald, what is the matter?

B:
	Well apparently Brad is dead, and you're in love with my sister?
