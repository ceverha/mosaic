A:
	How are you doing today? I haven't seen you in a while.

B:
	I'm doing great. I wish my dog didn't have to go and die though.

A:
	No. Oh, Eileen--Eileen, I'm so sorry!

B:
	Wait, who's Eileen? My name is Jeff.

A:
	Really? Now that's hard to believe. 

B:
	Well you better believe it buddy. My name is Jeff Yorker. The first of his name. Ruler of the house York.

A:
	[_nods_] Yes, I know.

B:
	(Shaking head) Then who the hell is Eileen then?!

A:
	It's all about finding the balance.

B:
	You sure are one hell of an idiot you know that?

A:
	I was on the top of the bank and I seen a priest coming down
the cross-road with his ass. It's collecting he is. We're going to set
ourselves here to beg something from him.

B:
	What? This is completely irrelevant to the question at hand. Are you a new breed of stupid?

A:
	That is surprising - I never thought about it like that before.

B:
	Well I'm surprise you think at all honestly.

A:
	JUNO. Am I to speak only to men who dislike me?

B:
	(Walking away with middle finger sticking up) Well I don't like you thats for sure.
