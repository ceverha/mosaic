	Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.

B:
	That's monica. She's the girl that just came to take care of Ms. Grover

A:
	Wonder who he was.

B:
	What do you mean "he"? Thats obviously a woman. Just look those toes. They are way too nice to be a man's.

A:
	I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.

B:
	Uh. Bro. Thats kinda gay wouldn't you say. (Backing up slowly with hands slightly raised)

A:
	Do they say that here?  How dreadful of them!

B:
	Welli guess gay isn't the correct political term. BUT I am for sure not homosexual.

A:
	You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.

B:
	How dare you? That case was closed shut. And I was found innocent. Don't you dare claim that again or you will never hear from me again. Lets jut go back to talking about Ms. Grover's new care taker.

A:
	No. I haven't seen anyone to-day.

B:
	Are you blind? She's right there

A:
	With you dead, what keeps me alive?

	You lack of observation surely doesn't

B:
	What? Are you okay?
