I had intercourse with your dog. I'm sorry.

Nonsense. I'm your friend. You mistook my intention because
I was drunk. Now that I am sober--in moderation--I will prove that I
am your friend. Have some diamonds. [Roaring.] Hullo there! Dogs, pigs:
hullo!
I. I don't know. The feeling and urge to have my penis inserted into those frail hairy beast is just too satisfying to not do it. Its a feeling like no other and I cannot live without it. (Mouth starts to water)

I suppose you think you're being sympathetic. You are just
foolish and stupid and selfish. You see me getting a smasher right in
the face that kills a whole part of my life: the best part that can
never come again; and you think you can help me over it by a little
coaxing and kissing. When I want all the strength I can get to lean on:
something iron, something stony, I don't care how cruel it is, you
go all mushy and want to slobber over me. I'm not angry; I'm not
unfriendly; but for God's sake do pull yourself together; and don't
think that because you're on velvet and always have been, women who are
in hell can take it as easily as you.
NO! I WILL NOT LEAVE UNTIL YOU ACCEPT ME FOR WHO I AM AND WHAT I DO. I FUCK DOGS. I FUCK THEM GOOD. I LOVE FUCKING THOSE LITTLE HAIRY TAIL CHASING FUCKERS AND I WILL CONTINUE TO FUCK THEM UNTIL THE DAY I DIE. YOU AND YOUR SAD LITTLE LIFE CAN DO DIE IN A HOLE BEFORE I WILL EVEN THNK TWICE OF STOPING.

I am not going to let you do that. I mean to look after myself;
over there, I am sure I can do that. Only let me get away from here.
Oh, these women!--you don't know--they have written to me today,
too--exhorting me to realise my good fortune--impressing on me how
magnanimous he has been. Tomorrow, and every day afterwards, they would
be watching me to see if I were making myself worthy of it all. I am
sick and tired of all this goodness!
Fine. You were never good in bed anyways. (Walks away)

[Irritably.] Yes, and I've been walking around that damned garden
half the night watching over him. Isn't that enough to wear anyone out?
I can feel I've got a terrible cold coming on--
