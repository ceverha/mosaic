A:
	How are you doing today? I haven't seen you in a while.

B:
	I'm doing well. How have you been?

A:
	No, I haven't. It has been just one thing after another! And all
my life I have tried to keep clear of such things!

B:
	It has been quite chaotic lately. What kind of things are you up to?

A:
	Really? Now that's hard to believe. 

B:
	Is it hard to believe? The world these days is crazy.

A:
	Ah, go on, Erich! What you say heals my heart.

B:
	Well the constant insanity of time and space can be quite comforting to simple specimens as ourselves.

A:
	It's all about finding the balance.

B:
	Exactly! The balance between peace and chaos, time and space, et cetera

A:
	My dear Mitchener, the moon is outside practical politics. Id
swop it for a cooling station tomorrow with Germany or any other Power
sufficiently military in its way of thinking to attach any importance to
it.

B:
	The moon is not outside such things! Do you deny there is not advantage in securing a piece of land so majestic?

A:
	That is surprising - I never thought about it like that before.

B:
	Most people don't. That's why it is largely considered useless.

A:
	 Shall we say paternal sentimentality?  I'm extremely sorry
to shock you; but you must remember that Ive been educated to discuss
human affairs with three fathers simultaneously.  I'm an adult person.
Patsy is an adult person.  You do not inspire me with veneration.
Apparently you do not inspire Patsy with veneration.  That may
surprise you.  It may pain you.  I'm sorry.  It cant be helped.  What
about the money?

B:
	The money!? (throws hands up in the air) how can you speak of money in such a discussion?
