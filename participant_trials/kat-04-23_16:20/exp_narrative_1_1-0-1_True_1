A:
	We are lost in this cave. How much more battery power do we have left?

B:
	We're down to 12%. We need to conserve it.

A:
	No, you will never need to waste a thought upon such matters.
And that's a good thing, too, in its way, dear Bolette, isn't it? Eh?

B:
	Do you mean you thought of a way to save us?

A:
	How much food do we have left? I'm beginning to worry.

B:
	We have enough for another day or so. This was just supposed to be a short trip.

A:
	Poor little Annette!

B:
	We can't worry about her now, we need to find a way out first.

A:
	Look! Is that a shaft of light I see?

B:
	Wait! Don't move so fast!

A:
	Is it done?

B:
	It looks like it could be our way out, but we need to be careful.

A:
	Hooray! We've escaped!

B:
	Now we need to find Annette!

A:
	Yes, indeed I shall, Torvald. But I can't get on a bit without you
to help me; I have absolutely forgotten the whole thing.

B:
	It seems like you've forgotten my name too. Did you hit your head?
