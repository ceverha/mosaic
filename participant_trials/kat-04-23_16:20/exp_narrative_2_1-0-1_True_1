A:
	How are you doing today? I haven't seen you in a while.

B:
	I'm doing ok, it's been a busy morning. Had to get up earlier than usual.

A:
	(_speaking with difficulty_) It got--set too soon.

B:
	What did? Are you ok?

A:
	Really? Now that's hard to believe. 

B:
	Dude what are you talking about?

A:
	Five hundred francs?

B:
	For what?

A:
	It's all about finding the balance.

B:
	I guess you're right. What do francs have to do with that?

A:
	You ought to apply to Peter Mortensgaard.

B:
	Isn't that an investment banking firm?

A:
	That is surprising - I never thought about it like that before.

B:
	(_laughing_) Hey, now that's a bit harsh! They do their best.

A:
	I think I know what you mean, and you know I don't think you are a
fool, or crazy.

B:
	Woah, I never thought you did. Though maybe I should be worried...
