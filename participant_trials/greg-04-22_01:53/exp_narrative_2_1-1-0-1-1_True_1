A:
	How are you doing today? I haven't seen you in a while.

B:
	Not so great. My car got destroyed in the hail storm last night.

C:
	I'm ok. I'm the one with the insurance policy on the car, so I am expecting a decent financial windfall. 

A:
	No no. Sit down. I was only consulting him. I'm rather out of
sorts. Overwork, I suppose.

B:
	We didn't ask how you're doing.

C:
	Don't mind her, she's in a mood. I'm sorry to hear that, would you like to talk some more?

A:
	Really? Now that's hard to believe. 

B:
	I'm not my best self right now. I haven't been to yoga in months.

C:
	I'm serious, if you want to talk about what is going on I'm happy to listen. My friend's car was just destroyed, and it's been a rough couple months. Perhaps we can all go out and grab a couple of margaritas at the new Taco Bell Cabana? I've been craving the Mountain Dew Baja Blast.

A:
	But I always thought being a
reporter was so interesting.

B:
	I really feel like you aren't present during this conversation.

C:
	Kamia, please listen to what A is trying to say! A, please continue. 

A:
	It's all about finding the balance.

B:
	That's what I'm missing without the yoga. My warrior pose is so lopsided.

C:
	I hope you both find that balance. Last call to join for some Taco Bell margaritas!

A:
	Things is best at home, that's right. O' course, there's one here now, a
doctor I mean, but he ain't good for much. They say somethin' queer
happened to him onct--got his ears boxed too hard or somethin'. An' they
say that made him kind o' melancholious. That ain't much good for his
patients! No sick man can't get well through that. I'll send for you,
Doctor, if I need help.

B:
	Don't think he should join us for margs, Greg.

C:
	Interesting that you gendered the AI. But I'm agreeing with you, let's get out of here.

A:
	That is surprising - I never thought about it like that before.

B:
	We broke it, Greg.

C:
	What gender did you think you were AI?

A:
	Well it might do MÃ¶ller good if he heard what she says!

B:
	Looks like the AI needs to moller over some gender studies theories.

C:
	Haha!
