	Ooh good story. You keep talking with AI and I'll go bury that dude.

A:
	She's well an' she sends her redards an' you'll please tome in ze morning

B:
	Is this what improv is like? Thank god I turned down that Tinder guy who wanted to go to a class on our first date.

C:
	!!! I think it knows and is trying to tell us that dude was a DUDETTE and is ok! Either we're saved, or we're in deep doodoo. You're right... that does sound like an improve scene.

A:
	I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.

	Does the I in AI stand for improv?

C:
	If so, the A probably just stands for Alright because this is not funny!
