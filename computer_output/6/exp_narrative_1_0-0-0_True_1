A:
	We are lost in this cave. How much more battery power do we have left?

B:
	But, Thomas dear, the imprudent things you said had
something to do with it, you know.

A:
	I told you true!

B:
	But how can this well-bred man be so tactless?

A:
	How much food do we have left? I'm beginning to worry.

B:
	Father, forgive me for all that
I have neglected to do! You shall see how I will try and make up for it!
How hard I shall work!

A:
	But what for?

B:
	I don't know. If it were for anything small enough to
know, it would be too small to die for. I think I'm going to die
for God. Nothing else is real enough to die for.

A:
	Look! Is that a shaft of light I see?

B:
	Of course. What else?

A:
	But I mean your first serious one.

B:
	It is on that account that you must not marry her.

A:
	Hooray! We've escaped!

B:
	 _[shortly, but without ill-temper]_  Oh:  is that so?

A:
	It is you who have sinned.  You have done to death all the
gladness of my life in me.

B:
	Mother, I didnâ€™t know you loved me so much as that.  And I will
be a better son to you than I have been.  And you and I must never leave
each other .
