Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.
<===>
The love that accomplishes things--hm--that is a fairy tale,
a girl's dream; and yet, perhaps it is as it should be. [He shrugs his
shoulders] How can I tell? [Gaily] On my honour, Sasha, I really am
quite a respectable man. Judge for yourself: I have always liked to
discuss things, but I have never in my life said that our women were
corrupt, or that such and such a woman was on the down-hill path. I have
always been grateful, and nothing more. No, nothing more. Dear child,
how comical you are! And what a ridiculous old stupid I am! I shock all
good Christian folk, and go about complaining from morning to night.
[He laughs and then leaves her suddenly] But you must go, Sasha; we have
forgotten ourselves.

Yes, it is time to go. Good-bye. I am afraid that that honest
doctor of yours will have told Anna out of a sense of duty that I am
here. Take my advice:
<===>
Yes, yes! I am sure of that, dear! It is not for that I am
referring to it now. I only want to remind you that I, on my side, was
frank with you. I told you quite openly that once in my life I had cared
for another. That there had been a--a kind of engagement between us.

A kind of--
<===>
What sort of book? A good one?

I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.
<===>
Oh, you won't admit it, I know. But I call it the most decisive
victory of my life. I love Mrs. Falk--and she loves me.

If you were not in such an excited condition--
<===>
You were not in a condition to, gov’nor.

S. Do you mean to say that _I_--?
<===>
You mean to say that you did it!

You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.
<===>
Be quiet! When you found that I wasn't bringing you any money,
you tried another game. Now I remember and understand everything. [She
begins to cry] You have never loved me or been faithful to me--never!

Sarah! That is a lie! Say what you want, but don't insult me
with a lie!
<===>
Of course it's ridiculous. Well, that's what my eyes tell
me. (Gloria makes a movement of contemptuous protest.) No: I'm not
flattering. I tell you I don't believe it. (She is ashamed to find that
this does not quite please her either.) Do you think that if you were
to turn away in disgust from my weakness, I should sit down here and cry
like a child?

And I am a feminine prig.
<===>
Thank you, very much. I am only a common man--

With you dead, what keeps me alive?
<===>
What’s the good of my telling you? It’s all over. There’s
nothing left. He didn’t love me: he never loved me. He’s gone. He’s
going to marry another woman.

He’s _gone_?
<===>
All gone already?

I am here.
<===>
I--? Well, I am here.
