A:
	Let me get this straight. You did what?

B:
	[_Screaming._] Do I have to stand for that, that I gotta drag in two
loads o' wood at night!

A:
	Why, he was _dead_.

B:
	Princess, the young captain has just killed himself.

A:
	I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.

B:
	Mother?

A:
	Do you miss your mother very much?

B:
	[_ironically_] Of course.

A:
	Get out! GET OUT!

B:
	Rest easy, little one--you do.

A:
	Do you know, Captain Paquito, that I've married no less
than seventeen men (Brassbound stares) to other women. And they all
opened the subject by saying that they would never marry anybody but me.

B:
	Men are not like that.

A:
	I don't care. Don't speak to me again.

B:
	Not me. I don't want never to see him again, I don't. He's a
disgrace to me, he is, collecting dust, instead of working at his trade.

A:
	What's happened here?

B:
	One of our beloved Hindus made himself obnoxious on the
campus. Giving out handbills about freedom for India--howling over
deportation. Our American boys wouldn't stand for it. A policeman saw
the fuss--came up and started to put the Hindu in his place.
