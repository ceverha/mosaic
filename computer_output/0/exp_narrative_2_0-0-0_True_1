A:
	How are you doing today? I haven't seen you in a while.

B:
	You are an exceedingly clever lady-killer, Hector. And
terribly handsome. I am quite a good player, myself, at that game. Is it
quite understood that we are only playing?

A:
	My dear Miss Worsley, I thought you liked English
society so much.  You were such a success in it.  And you were so much
admired by the best people.  I quite forget what Lord Henry Weston said
of youâ€”but it was most complimentary,

B:
	I should fancy not at all, Jane.

A:
	Really? Now that's hard to believe. 

B:
	Yes, I believe it thoroughly. And so--after a few
years--when I come home again as a celebrated sculptor, and well off,
and in perfect health!

A:
	[Jumping up in anger.]  Is this meant for me?  A reproach----!

B:
	[_Jumping on a bench--hecticly_] Hinsultin' us! Hinsultin' us,
the bloody cow! And them bloody engineers! What right 'as they got to
be exhibitin' us 's if we was bleedin' monkeys in a menagerie?

A:
	It's all about finding the balance.

B:
	But what has that to do with us?

A:
	Just this much, that if I had been an ordinary stay-at-home man, a
great many things would not have happened.

B:
	And what in the world did my poor wife find to write to you
about?

A:
	That is surprising - I never thought about it like that before.

B:
	How? Try and tell me a little more calmly and consecutively!

A:
	[Manfully.] That's my word, and I'll stick to it!

B:
	Mr. John, to play the part of an arbitrator between married people is not
ordinarily my function. It's too thankless a task and one's experiences
are, as a rule, too unhappy. But you should not permit your feeling of
honour,
