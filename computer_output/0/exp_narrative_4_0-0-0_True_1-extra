Similarity pairs

Let me get this straight. You did what?
<===>
Yes, you see how much I need it. You must coach me up to the last
minute. Promise me that, Torvald!

You can depend on me.
<===>
You can depend on me; and you know it, I think.

You know also, Mr. Johnson, I hope, that you can depend on
ME.
<===>
You shouldn't say things like that, Jack. I hope you
won't tell Ann that I have been speaking to you. I only wanted to
set myself right with you and Tavy. I couldn't sit mumchance and have
everything put on me.

I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.
<===>
You may be certain, Miss Valborg, that when I am balancing our
account you shall not suffer any injustice. But I cannot do it now. All
I have to do now is to get ready to go.

But you are not ready to go, Sannaes! You have not finished
your work here yet! There is what I just spoke of--and something else
that dates farther back than that.
<===>
[Still in the background.]  Why do you run away from
me?  What good will that do?  There can be no wedding anyway
before I come.

[Notices LADY KIRSTEN and her retinue.]  Lady Kirsten!
you here?  Well, I am glad of that.
<===>
Olaf loves her!  'Tis many a time he visited her up
there;--what Lady Kirsten has told you, you must never believe.

Get out! GET OUT!
<===>
I want to get away from them!

Rest easy, little one--you do.
<===>
You look tired. You must rest a little!

(_Shakes his head_) If Herr Muhlingk, Junior, sends word, or
comes himself, call me. (_He goes off_)
<===>
How delicious that sounds! Bring him back! (Gets up, then stops.)
Thank you, my dear, sweet, darling aunt! (She runs out. LEONARDA falls
into a chair by the table and buries her head in her hands. AAGOT'S
voice is heard without: "Yes, come along!" and HAGBART'S, answering: "Is
it true?")

I don't care. Don't speak to me again.
<===>
Oh--father. I don't know what to do.

Nothing stays at home. Not even the corn stays at home. If only the
wind wouldn't blow! Why can't I have my field to myself? Why can't I
keep what's mine? All these years I've worked to make it better.
<===>
(_swiftly rising_) You're a cruel woman--a hard, insolent
woman! I knew what I was doing! What do you know about it? About me? I
didn't go to the Outside. I was left there. I'm only--trying to get
along. Everything that can hurt me I want buried--buried deep. Spring is
here. This morning I _knew_ it. Spring--coming through the storm--to
take me--take me to hurt me. That's why I couldn't bear--(_she looks at
the closed door_) things that made me know I feel. You haven't felt for
so long you don't know what it means! But I tell you, Spring is here!
And now you'd take _that_ from me--(_looking now toward the edge of the
woods_) the thing that made me know they would be buried in my
heart--those things I can't _live_ and know I feel. You're more cruel
than the sea! 'But other things are true beside the things you want to
see!' Outside. Springs will come when I will not know that it is spring.
(_as if resentful of not more deeply believing what she says_) What
would there be for me but the Outside? What was there for you? What did
you ever find after you lost the thing you wanted?

I found--what I find now I know. The edge of life--to hold
life behind me--
<===>
Out, out from my sight! I want someone with belief. I must find that
grain the Angel spoke of before I die. I tell you I must find it, and
you answer me with arguments. Out with you, out of my sight!
