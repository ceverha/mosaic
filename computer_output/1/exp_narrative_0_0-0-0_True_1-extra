Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.
<===>
Has he come with you? (Caesar shakes his head: she is cruelly
disappointed.) Oh, I wish he had, I wish he had. If only I were a little
older; so that he might not think me a mere kitten, as you do! But
perhaps that is because YOU are old. He is many, MANY years younger than
you, is he not?

Would he be my husband, do you think, if I asked him?
<===>
No, I can't say as he has. Not that I know. An' I wouldn't advise him to
try neither. Only when I sees him I gets kind o' sick at my stomick. You
oughta have married him yourself.

If I had been thirty years younger--sure enough.
<===>
For many years, I have felt that once you were mine and
that I had lost you. Now I know that you never have been mine yet; but
I shall win you.

I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.
<===>
O, but wait. I understand you. Thomas doesn’t understand your thoughts,
but I understand them. Wasn’t I telling you I was just like you once?

Like me? Did you ever see the other things, the things beyond?
<===>
Do you understand what is in my Mind, then? Do you not know? Do
you not see how I could best win my freedom from all these harrowing
memories from the whole sad past?

Tell me!
<===>
Tell me, darling, tell me.

You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.
<===>
Mother, I didn’t know you loved me so much as that.  And I will
be a better son to you than I have been.  And you and I must never leave
each other . . . but, mother . . . I can’t help it . . . you must become
my father’s wife.  You must marry him.  It is your duty.

[_Running forwards and embracing_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  No, no; you
shall not.  That would be real dishonour, the first you have ever known.
That would be real disgrace: the first to touch you.
<===>
Yes, that's the way it is. And nevertheless need should be the
strongest motive, the only one to be pardoned. But I can change that as
little as I can change my will not to steal under any condition.

And you count it a great virtue that you cannot--h'm--steal?
<===>
There are worse things than that, and for that matter when I serve
in a house I regard myself as a member of the family, a child of the
house as it were. And one doesn't consider it theft if children snoop
a berry from full bushes. [With renewed passion]. Miss Julie, you are a
glorious woman--too good for such as I. You have been the victim of an
infatuation and you want to disguise this fault by fancying that you
love me. But you do not--unless perhaps my outer self attracts you. And
then your love is no better than mine. But I cannot be satisfied with
that, and your real love I can never awaken.

With you dead, what keeps me alive?
<===>
[_gravely_] Ah, my dear! If I hadn’t you what would become of
me! [_A silence_] But you’re telling me _nothing_. You don’t seem to be
telling me the truth—you’re hiding something from me—there _is_ some
difficulty, I’m certain of it. If there wasn’t you’d say there wasn’t,
you wouldn’t put me off—you’d tell me what Madame Bernin said.

Well—there is something.
<===>
Is there anything--?

Yes.
<===>
[Warmly.]  Yes, yes do it!  Oh, help him, Erhart!
