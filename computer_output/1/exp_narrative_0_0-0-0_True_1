A:
	Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.

B:
	Would he be my husband, do you think, if I asked him?

A:
	If I had been thirty years younger--sure enough.

B:
	Oh, Betty, you have won me. It was
through Lona that I first learned really to know you. But now let Olaf
come to me.

A:
	I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.

B:
	Like me? Did you ever see the other things, the things beyond?

A:
	Tell me!

B:
	[_with violence_] Oh, I’ll tell you. You’ll despise me a
little more; but what can that matter to me now? First he pretended not
to understand me: he forced me to say it quite plainly:

A:
	You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.

B:
	[_Running forwards and embracing_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  No, no; you
shall not.  That would be real dishonour, the first you have ever known.
That would be real disgrace: the first to touch you.

A:
	And you count it a great virtue that you cannot--h'm--steal?

B:
	Are you sure of that?

A:
	With you dead, what keeps me alive?

B:
	Well—there is something.

A:
	Yes.

B:
	I don't care about myself.
