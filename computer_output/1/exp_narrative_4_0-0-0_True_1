A:
	Let me get this straight. You did what?

B:
	[_Screaming._] Do I have to stand for that, that I gotta drag in two
loads o' wood at night!

A:
	Certainly, Mrs. Wolff, I can well believe that.

B:
	So you see it would be an easy matter for me to set on foot
some testimonial, if necessary.

A:
	I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.

B:
	In a few days, I guess. Don't be impatient. (Murray
_grunts and moves nervously on his chair._) What's the matter? Don't
you like us here at the Sanatorium?

A:
	[_Coming over to him._] He is running hard! He must be in some
danger----

B:
	So he has gone out, has he! Oh, well, he is bound to come in
again! I will wait and catch him, that I will! Tra, la, la, la, la! I
can play about here in the fog till he comes back;

A:
	Get out! GET OUT!

B:
	Rest easy, little one--you do.

A:
	Do you know, Captain Paquito, that I've married no less
than seventeen men (Brassbound stares) to other women. And they all
opened the subject by saying that they would never marry anybody but me.

B:
	I implore you to do what I ask you.

A:
	I don't care. Don't speak to me again.

B:
	Nothing stays at home. Not even the corn stays at home. If only the
wind wouldn't blow! Why can't I have my field to myself? Why can't I
keep what's mine? All these years I've worked to make it better.

A:
	I have thrown myself imploringly at His feet, but always in
vain!

B:
	No; no one spoke. I heard some one weeping as he walked; and then I
fainted....
