I can't believe you threw that ball over the fence. Now you're going to have to go into that dark, scary, spooky forest all by yourself!
<===>
[Violently.] Well, living with you is enough to drive anyone off
their nut. Your bunk about the farm being so fine! Didn't I write you
year after year how rotten it was and what a dirty slave them cousins
made of me? What'd you care? Nothing! Not even enough to come out and
see me! That crazy bull about wanting to keep me away from the sea
don't go down with me! You yust didn't want to be bothered with me!
You're like all the rest of 'em!

[Feebly.] Anna! It ain't so--
<===>
It made me horribly uneasy.

Why didn't you tell me? I'd have put it down at once.
<===>
All right. Maybe I do. But don't rub it in. Why ain't you done
what you said you was going to? Why ain't you got that ship was going
to take you to the other side of the earth where you'd never see me
again?

Hurry up! You're making me worried. [hears scream] What was that? Hold on!
<===>
POPOV. Nothing. You may go. But--wait a moment. No, go on, go on. I
hate you. Or--no; don't go. Oh, if you knew how angry I was, how angry!
[_She throws the revolver on to the chair._] My finger is swollen from
this thing. [_She angrily tears her handkerchief._] What are you
standing there for? Get out!

Farewell!
<===>
----Then farewell to your life.

My----?  But I am not Count Sture.
<===>
Father, Mother, I ask your forgiveness, but what I am doing
now I must do! I am sure that it can't be wrong. But I beg of you,
think kindly of me--sometimes.

It hurts so much, make it stop!
<===>
So it does.

Stop, Rank; this is sheer madness. Stop, I tell you! (RANK stops
playing, and NORA suddenly stands still. HELMER goes up to her.) I could
never have believed it. You have forgotten everything I taught you.
<===>
Be quiet! When you found that I wasn't bringing you any money,
you tried another game. Now I remember and understand everything. [She
begins to cry] You have never loved me or been faithful to me--never!

Sarah! That is a lie! Say what you want, but don't insult me
with a lie!
<===>
Of course it's ridiculous. Well, that's what my eyes tell
me. (Gloria makes a movement of contemptuous protest.) No: I'm not
flattering. I tell you I don't believe it. (She is ashamed to find that
this does not quite please her either.) Do you think that if you were
to turn away in disgust from my weakness, I should sit down here and cry
like a child?

Be quiet. 
<===>
Be quiet, will you?

Shut up, canâ€™t you?
<===>
Sit down! Shut up! Damn fool! Sea-lawyer! [_Long slinks back out
of sight._]

[_Continuing the trend of his thoughts as if he had never been
interrupted--bitterly._] And there she was standing behind us, and the
Second pointing at us like a man you'd hear in a circus would be
saying:
<===>
There were no accusers, no suspicions, no witnesses. It happened
this way: one Christmas a friend of mine had invited me for a few days'
hunting just outside of Upsala; he sent an old drunken servant to meet
me, who fell asleep on the coach-box and drove into a gate-post, which
landed us in the ditch. It was not because my life had been in danger,
but in a fit of anger I struck him a blow to wake him, with the result
that he never awakened again--he died on the spot.
