Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.
<===>
I do remember quite dimly now what you mean. It was quite at the end of
her life.--But I confess to you quite frankly: I didn't take that matter
so very seriously. Your wife was in a very excited condition. And that
was caused largely by her illness.--I can't think that that is the main
question. The real question must finally be whether Hanne is really
suitable for you! She has her advantageous qualities: no doubt about
that. There are things about her that I like less. However: who hasn't
some faults. People say that she has a child.

That she has. I've inquired. Well, even so. I don't care nothin' about
that. Was she to wait for me, eh? She didn't know nothin' about me when
that happened. She's hot-blooded;
<===>
(_proudly_) Oh, I know that! You think I could work with her
and not know she's more than I know she is?

Well, if you love her you've got to let me shoot the dirty dog
that drags her down!
<===>
Because I wanted to smash your face. I'd like to kill you, you
selfish brute. Why didn't you leave me where you picked me out of--in
the gutter? You thank God it's all over, and that now you can throw me
back again there, do you? [She crisps her fingers, frantically].

I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.
<===>
I love you! It is you I have loved in her--since the very first
day. I love you!

Then have respect for me--and go!
<===>
For me they have chosen already--once and for all.

[Looks earnestly at her.] Hilda--you are like a wild bird of the woods.
<===>
(or all three musicians, singing)
  Why does my heart beat so?
  Did not a shadow pass?
  It passed but a moment ago.
  Who can have trod in the grass?
  What rogue is night-wandering?
  Have not old writers said
  That dizzy dreams can spring
  From the dry bones of the dead?
  And many a night it seems
  That all the valley fills
  With those fantastic dreams.
  They overflow the hills,
  So passionate is a shade,
  Like wine that fills to the top
  A grey-green cup of jade,
  Or maybe an agate cup.
  (speaking) The hour before dawn and the moon covered up.
  The little village of Abbey is covered up;
  The little narrow trodden way that runs
  From the white road to the Abbey of Corcomroe
  Is covered up; and all about the hills
  Are like a circle of Agate or of Jade.
  Somewhere among great rocks on the scarce grass
  Birds cry, they cry their loneliness.
  Even the sunlight can be lonely here,
  Even hot noon is lonely. I hear a footfall--
  A young man with a lantern comes this way.
  He seems an Aran fisher, for he wears
  The flannel bawneen and the cow-hide shoe.
  He stumbles wearily, and stumbling prays.

You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.
<===>
Be quiet! When you found that I wasn't bringing you any money,
you tried another game. Now I remember and understand everything. [She
begins to cry] You have never loved me or been faithful to me--never!

Sarah! That is a lie! Say what you want, but don't insult me
with a lie!
<===>
Margret! Forgive me, but believe me when I say that there is no
one here who wishes me well but you. Help me, for I feel that something
is going to happen here. What it is, I don't know, but something evil is
on the way. [Scream from within.] What's that? Who's that screaming?

Father! Father! Help me; save me.
<===>
God help me!  What's here!
My mother!

With you dead, what keeps me alive?
<===>
[Desperately.] But what's come over you so sudden? You was
saying you loved me--

I'll say that as often as you want me to. It's true.
<===>
Oh, I'll play fair. I'll admit they did--then. But it's
exasperating to know they never give you credit for changing--I almost
said, reforming, One ought to be above the gossip of a town like
this--but say what you like, it does get under your skin.

[With an indulgent smile.] So you'd like to be known as a
reformed character, eh?
<===>
As a schoolmaster, yes; but not as a father. And it is a father
that I want henceforth to be to Eyolf.
