Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.
<===>
The love that accomplishes things--hm--that is a fairy tale,
a girl's dream; and yet, perhaps it is as it should be. [He shrugs his
shoulders] How can I tell? [Gaily] On my honour, Sasha, I really am
quite a respectable man. Judge for yourself: I have always liked to
discuss things, but I have never in my life said that our women were
corrupt, or that such and such a woman was on the down-hill path. I have
always been grateful, and nothing more. No, nothing more. Dear child,
how comical you are! And what a ridiculous old stupid I am! I shock all
good Christian folk, and go about complaining from morning to night.
[He laughs and then leaves her suddenly] But you must go, Sasha; we have
forgotten ourselves.

Yes, it is time to go. Good-bye. I am afraid that that honest
doctor of yours will have told Anna out of a sense of duty that I am
here. Take my advice:

What was that you said a few moments ago? "I am the calamity child. I
am the child of misery; but I do not ask for charity." That is what you
said of yourself, and it is also true of me. I, too, am a child of
misery, a calamity child; but I am a subject of charity. I accept all
they have to give--all--all--ha, ha, ha----!

You, George, a calamity child?
<===>
She is a sweet child. [A pause] A woman, Constantine, asks only
for kind looks. I know that from experience.

I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.
<===>
Oh, you won't admit it, I know. But I call it the most decisive
victory of my life. I love Mrs. Falk--and she loves me.

If you were not in such an excited condition--
<===>
Mrs. Arbuthnot, I wish you would let us be friends.  You are so
different from the other women here.  When you came into the Drawing-room
this evening, somehow you brought with you a sense of what is good and
pure in life.  I had been foolish.  There are things that are right to
say, but that may be said at the wrong time and to the wrong people.

I heard what you said.  I agree with it, Miss Worsley.
<===>
If I was doing it proper, what was you laughing at? [To Higgins]
Have I said anything I oughtn't?

You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.
<===>
Be quiet! When you found that I wasn't bringing you any money,
you tried another game. Now I remember and understand everything. [She
begins to cry] You have never loved me or been faithful to me--never!

Sarah! That is a lie! Say what you want, but don't insult me
with a lie!
<===>
Margret! Forgive me, but believe me when I say that there is no
one here who wishes me well but you. Help me, for I feel that something
is going to happen here. What it is, I don't know, but something evil is
on the way. [Scream from within.] What's that? Who's that screaming?

Father! Father! Help me; save me.
<===>
My father is waiting for me.

With you dead, what keeps me alive?
<===>
What’s the good of my telling you? It’s all over. There’s
nothing left. He didn’t love me: he never loved me. He’s gone. He’s
going to marry another woman.

He’s _gone_?
<===>
She has gone away?

She loves the man you--? Good God, look at Hagbart!
<===>
Now MY father is a wonderful man if you like.
