A:
	I can't believe you threw that ball over the fence. Now you're going to have to go into that dark, scary, spooky forest all by yourself!

B:
	Miss Claire! Miss Claire! The work of years!

A:
	Oh, is that you, Nurse? How are you? You don't look a
day older. Is nobody at home? Where is Hesione? Doesn't she expect me?
Where are the servants? Whose luggage is that on the steps?

B:
	Even if you have them daily before your eyes, Miss Krause. Indeed. I
think that is necessary if one is to discover what is truly interesting
about them.

A:
	Hurry up! You're making me worried. [hears scream] What was that? Hold on!

B:
	Farewell!

A:
	I am glad to hear it!

B:
	But, do you see--?

A:
	It hurts so much, make it stop!

B:
	I am here!...

A:
	A very clever woman.  Knows perfectly well what a demmed
fool I am—knows it as well as I do myself.

B:
	He left me nothing but the bones and feathers. Nothing but the
feathers, though I had stolen it.

A:
	Be quiet. 

B:
	Shut up, can’t you?

A:
	[_taking her by the arm_] Hold your tongue, I tell you.

B:
	My last bit of news? I have no fresh news! There is nothing
more to tell!
