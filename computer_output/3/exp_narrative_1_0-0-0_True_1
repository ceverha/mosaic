B:

me go!

A:
	How much food do we have left? I'm beginning to worry.

B:
	Father, forgive me for all that
I have neglected to do! You shall see how I will try and make up for it!
How hard I shall work!

A:
	Pastor, do you know who and what I am?

B:
	Whose daughter I am, I mean?

A:
	Look! Is that a shaft of light I see?

B:

B:

B:
	Yes, you must stay in the house.

A:

When

B:
	Go away. I have other things to think of now than giving you pennies.
