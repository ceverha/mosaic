We are lost in this cave. How much more battery power do we have left?
<===>
And you have no right to; no right to despise me! Lona, you
can have no idea how utterly alone I stand in this cramped and stunted
community--where I have had, year after year, to stifle my ambition for
a fuller life. My work may seem many-sided, but what have I really
accomplished? Odds and ends--scraps. They would not stand anything else
here. If I were to go a step in advance of the opinions and views that
are current at the moment, I should lose all my influence. Do you know
what we are--we who are looked upon as pillars of society? We are
nothing more, nor less, than the tools of society.

Why have you only begun to realise that now?
<===>
That I can well believe, father, if only you have the time necessary to
do it.

Because, in twenty-four hours, I shall be a dead man.
<===>
[Under her breath, but firmly.] No. But then this long,
hateful comedy will be ended. From the day after to-morrow, I shall act
in every way as though he who is dead had never lived in this house.
There shall be no one here but my boy and his mother.

How much food do we have left? I'm beginning to worry.
<===>
Don't you understand, dear? I believe I could become of some
use in the office. And in that way, you know, we might begin afresh--and
try, with God's help, to pay your creditors.

Father, forgive me for all that
I have neglected to do! You shall see how I will try and make up for it!
How hard I shall work!
<===>
[_Disturbed_.] My dear Miss Marie, I do not understand the reason for
your agitation, and I will not question you! But of your struggles--you
shall know that you have a friend near you, on whom you can rely, now
and for all time to come. Marie, I don't know how to express myself;
but I desire to shield and protect you all your life--I will worship
you----

Pastor, do you know who and what I am?
<===>
Do you really not know who I am?

Look! Is that a shaft of light I see?
<===>
Oh, certainly. Ive quite done with you. [Rising and holding up
the sketch block] There! While youve been talking, Ive been doing. What
is there left of your moralizing? Only a little carbonic acid gas which
makes the room unhealthy. What is there left of my work? That. Look at
it [Ridgeon rises to look at it].

Of course. What else?
<===>
Of course it does!

From our dear Herr Kurt, I suppose?
<===>
My dear Oswald, you don't know her as I do--

Hooray! We've escaped!
<===>
If I could only escape seeing him!

Yes, you must stay in the house.
<===>
The third night after----?  Ay, right enough.--Would
you seek the lady of the house at once?  I think she is not yet
gone to rest.  But might you not sit down and rest awhile, dear
young Sir?  See, here is yet a flagon of wine remaining, and
doubtless you will find some food.  Come, fall to; you will do
wisely to refresh your strength.

You are right, Sir; 'twere not amiss.
    (Sits down by the table and eats and drinks.)
Both roast meat and sweet cakes!  Why, you live like lords here!
When
<===>
What is eaten is gone. I want pennies for my bag. I must buy bacon
in the shops, and nuts in the market, and strong drink for the time
when the sun is weak. And I want snares to catch the rabbits and the
squirrels and the hares, and a pot to cook them in.
