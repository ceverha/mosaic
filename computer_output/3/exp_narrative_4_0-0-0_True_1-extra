Similarity pairs

Let me get this straight. You did what?
<===>
What have you got to tell me?

whole lot of things; but I shall begin with the ending. We must
dissolve this concubinage.
<===>
We cannot work that way now-a-days. You must not imagine,
Aune, that it is for the sake of making profit; I do not need that,
fortunately; but I owe consideration to the community I live in, and to
the business I am at the head of. I must take the lead in progress, or
there would never be any.

I welcome progress too, Mr. Bernick.
<===>
I know that quite well, Mr. Aslaksen.

I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.
<===>
You may be certain, Miss Valborg, that when I am balancing our
account you shall not suffer any injustice. But I cannot do it now. All
I have to do now is to get ready to go.

But you are not ready to go, Sannaes! You have not finished
your work here yet! There is what I just spoke of--and something else
that dates farther back than that.
<===>
[Still in the background.]  Why do you run away from
me?  What good will that do?  There can be no wedding anyway
before I come.

[Notices LADY KIRSTEN and her retinue.]  Lady Kirsten!
you here?  Well, I am glad of that.
<===>
Lord Illingworth, every one has been congratulating me, Lady
Hunstanton and Lady Caroline, and . . . every one.  I hope I shall make a
good secretary.

Get out! GET OUT!
<===>
I want to get away from them!

Rest easy, little one--you do.
<===>
You've spoiled even that chance for me. Do you think I could
look at any ordinary woman after you? You seem to be able to make me
do pretty well what you like; but you can't make me marry anybody but
yourself.

Do you know, Captain Paquito, that I've married no less
than seventeen men (Brassbound stares) to other women. And they all
opened the subject by saying that they would never marry anybody but me.
<===>
Well, if there was more than one, I am sure I know nothing about
it. No, indeed I do not! Besides, the way people gossip and backbite is
the very devil! But, as I was saying, because he dared to look at some
one before he looked at you--before he ever _thought_ of you--is that a
reason for throwing him over for good and all? How many would ever get
married under those circumstances, I should like to know? Everybody
confirms the opinion that he is an honourable, fine young fellow, to
whom the proudest girl might confidently entrust herself--you said so
yourself, only a day or two ago! Do not deny it! And now he is suddenly
to be thrown over, because you are not the first girl he has ever met!
Pride should have some limits, remember! I have never heard of anything
more preposterous, if you ask me.

I don't care. Don't speak to me again.
<===>
Oh--father. I don't know what to do.

Nothing stays at home. Not even the corn stays at home. If only the
wind wouldn't blow! Why can't I have my field to myself? Why can't I
keep what's mine? All these years I've worked to make it better.
<===>
It doesn't seem to suit you when I take a notion to see a little
of the world. Because you are four years older than I, and because
you taught me to walk, you'd still like to have me tied to your
apron-strings. You--but I can go--alone now. There are ladies who have
said I go too far. Let me find heaven in my own way.

I have never interfered with you. Go on, play the
man-of-the world as much as you like, but have the courage to admit it.
<===>
All life seems to have become unclean for me! My nearest and
dearest all soiled and smirched! That is why, ever since yesterday,
I have had the feeling of being an outcast; and that is what I am--an
outcast from all that I prized and reverenced--and that without my
having done the slightest thing to deserve it. Even so, it is not the
pain of it that I feel most deeply; it is the humiliation, the shame.
All that I have so often said must seem now to be nothing but empty
words--all that I have done myself must seem of no account--and this
without its being my fault! For it is your fault! I thought, too, that
I knew something about life; but there was more for me to learn! I see
that you wanted me to give way to such an extent that I should end
by acquiescing in it. I understand now, for the first time, what your
teaching meant--and the things that you invoked mother and heaven to
witness. But it is of no use! I can tell you that it is about as much
as one can stand, to have the thoughts I have had yesterday--last
night--to-day. However, it is once and for all; after this, nothing can
ever take me by surprise again. To think that any man could have the
heart to let his child have such an experience!
