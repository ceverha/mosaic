A:
	Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.

B:
	Yes, it is time to go. Good-bye. I am afraid that that honest
doctor of yours will have told Anna out of a sense of duty that I am
here. Take my advice:

A:
	His voice is nearer. Fare you well, my tenant.
    When next your rent falls due, come to the castle.
    Pay me in person. Sir:

B:
	Is that any reason why you should be dependent on him? Dont
do it, Juggins: pay your own way like an honest lad; and dont eat your
brother's bread while youre able to earn your own.

A:
	I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.

B:
	If you were not in such an excited condition--

A:
	No, you certainly are not. But that makes you all the more
dangerous to those whom you wish to get into your power. It comes easy
to you to act with deliberation and careful calculation,

B:
	 Oh, I'm not a bit afraid of them, I assure you.

A:
	You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.

B:
	He went upstairs.

A:
	Not very bright?

B:
	One of your attacks?

A:
	With you dead, what keeps me alive?

B:
	Wellâ€”there is something.

A:
	Yes.

B:
	But--if you don't even know her----?
