A:
	Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.

B:
	Is there anything else?

A:
	No, no, not in the least. It is only something--it is my new
dress--

B:
	I don’t know if that is the ordinary ending, mother: I hope it
is not.  But your life, at any rate, shall not end like that.  The man
shall make whatever reparation is possible.

A:
	I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.

B:
	If you were not in such an excited condition--

A:
	I heard what you said.  I agree with it, Miss Worsley.

B:
	HIGGINS [interposing] Not at all, Miss Doolittle.

A:
	You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.

B:
	I too shall grow old, Ann. And when I am eighty, one white
hair of the woman I love will make me tremble more than the thickest
gold tress from the most beautiful young head.

A:
	She is of the faery people.

B:
	The spring mist is widespread abroad; so perhaps the wild olive's flower
will blossom in the infinitely unreachable moon. Her flowery
head-ornament is putting on colour; this truly is sign of the spring.

A:
	With you dead, what keeps me alive?

B:
	He’s _gone_?

A:
	She loves the man you--? Good God, look at Hagbart!

B:
	My coat!
