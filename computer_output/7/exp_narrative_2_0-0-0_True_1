A:
	How are you doing today? I haven't seen you in a while.

B:

B:
	Oh, she’s explained that.

A:
	Really? Now that's hard to believe. 

B:
	Yes, I believe it thoroughly. And so--after a few
years--when I come home again as a celebrated sculptor, and well off,
and in perfect health!

A:
	Yes; and a very good aunt to have, too. She’s living down
at Winchester now, close to the cathedral, one of the most respectable
ladies there. Chaperones girls at the country ball,

B:
	Are you still young?

A:
	It's all about finding the balance.

B:

A:
	Put on your cloak, Selma. Ax your mother if you c'n go an' take a trip

B:
	How? Try and tell me a little more calmly and consecutively!

A:
	What leave you got there, Asta?

B:
	[Looks at her, smiles and nods.] I got the horns! The horns that you can
see so plainly. Is not that a comical story, madam bear-murderess?
