Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.
<===>
Has he come with you? (Caesar shakes his head: she is cruelly
disappointed.) Oh, I wish he had, I wish he had. If only I were a little
older; so that he might not think me a mere kitten, as you do! But
perhaps that is because YOU are old. He is many, MANY years younger than
you, is he not?

Would he be my husband, do you think, if I asked him?
<===>
No, I can't say as he has. Not that I know. An' I wouldn't advise him to
try neither. Only when I sees him I gets kind o' sick at my stomick. You
oughta have married him yourself.

If I had been thirty years younger--sure enough.
<===>
Ten guineas, and expenses. I had to give Flawner Bannal ten.
He wouldnt come for less; and he asked fifty. I had to give it, because
if we hadnt had him we might just as well have had nobody at all.

I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.
<===>
[Stamps with his foot.]  Do not stare at me so, I say!  I
know you well enough; you have bewitched me.  I forgot my family;
I forgot my bride, my betrothed, she who stands there.

[Seizes ALFHILD violently by the arm.]  Look at her,
Alfhild!  Aha, it is she that I love!
<===>
Yes, there is an odour of mortality about it. It reminds me of a
bouquet--the day after the ball. [Clasps her hands behind her head,
leans back in her chair and looks at him.] Oh, my dear Judge--you cannot
imagine how horribly I shall bore myself here.

Why should not you, too, find some sort of vocation in life, Mrs. Hedda?
<===>
You told me once, that you lived your happiest life
in tales and histories.  What if that life were to be yours once
more?

You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.
<===>
Yes, do, dear! I couldn't, just now; and I am sure your
father couldn't either. You speak to him! (Gets up.) Come, Signe, you
and I must have a talk; you must open your heart to me now.--Ah, when
have we ever had a real talk together? (SIGNE goes to her.) Where is
your father?

He went upstairs.
<===>
He was silent--and went back.

Went back! But he'll return!----
<===>
Yes; he came up the back stairs.

With you dead, what keeps me alive?
<===>
[Desperately.] But what's come over you so sudden? You was
saying you loved me--

I'll say that as often as you want me to. It's true.
<===>
 Oh, thats only their way.  I used to think that the
aristocracy were a nasty sneering lot, and that they were laughing at
me and John.  Theyre always giggling and pretending not to care much
about anything.  But you get used to it:  theyre the same to one
another and to everybody.  Besides, what does it matter what they
think?  It's far worse when theyre civil, because that always means
that they want you to lend them money; and you must never do that,
Hypatia, because they never pay.  How can they?  They dont make
anything, you see.  Of course, if you can make up your mind to regard
it as a gift, thats different; but then they generally ask you again;
and you may as well say no first as last.  You neednt be afraid of the
aristocracy, dear:  theyre only human creatures like ourselves after
all; and youll hold your own with them easy enough.

 Oh, I'm not a bit afraid of them, I assure you.
<===>
Ã–STERMARK. What, drunk too?--I really pity you. Oh, this is most
unpleasant! Dear me, I believe I'm ready to cry!--Carolina! No, I can't
bear this!
