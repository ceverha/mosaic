A:
	How are you doing today? I haven't seen you in a while.

B:
	Do you like me best as I am?

A:
	No wonder your drawing's queer. A man who can't reach another
man--(TOM _here reaches them by pointing the revolver in the air and
firing it_. DICK _digs his hand into the dirt_.

B:
	[As he sees CHRIS--in a jovial tone of mockery.] Well, God bless
who's here! [He bends down and squeezes his huge form through the
narrow doorway.] And how is the world treating you this afternoon,
Anna's

A:
	Really? Now that's hard to believe. 

B:
	And I fancy it will be so
cheering for you, too--here in this out-of-the-way place-to know within
yourself that you are, so to say, helping me to create.

A:
	[angrily] And is a man never to have a bit of fun? See whats come
of it with your daughter! She was to be content with your happiness
that youre always talking about;

B:
	(_words coming from a throat not free_) Claire! What are you doing?
(_then she knows what she is doing_)

A:
	It's all about finding the balance.

B:
	(With emotion) You've come back!

A:
	That is what I like to see! A young man like Misha comes into
the room and in a minute he has everybody laughing. [She puts out the
large lamp] There is no reason the candles should burn for nothing so
long as they are all in the garden.

B:
	Oh, goodness, gracious! I clean forgot about it!

A:
	That is surprising - I never thought about it like that before.

B:
	You're a cruel man, really, Doctor. I can't go an' laugh about things
like that.

A:
	I've tried. I cannot. There is some inexorable force in me--

B:
	You know very well that I do.
