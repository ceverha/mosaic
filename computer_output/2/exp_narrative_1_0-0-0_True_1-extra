We are lost in this cave. How much more battery power do we have left?
<===>
It’s well that we should speak our minds out plainly,
  For when we die we shall be spoken of
  In many countries. We in our young days
  Have seen the heavens like a burning cloud
  Brooding upon the world, and being more
  Than men can be now that cloud’s lifted up,
  We should be the more truthful. Conchubar,
  I do not like your children—they have no pith,
  No marrow in their bones, and will lie soft
  Where you and I lie hard.

You rail at them
  Because you have no children of your own.

But not violently, I trust, Mr. Hovstad. Proceed with
moderation, or you will do nothing with them. You may take my advice; I
have gathered my experience in the school of life. Well, I must say
goodbye, Doctor. You know now that we small tradesmen are at your back
at all events, like a solid wall. You have the compact majority on your
side Doctor.

I am very much obliged, dear Mr. Aslaksen, (Shakes hands
with him.) Goodbye, goodbye.

I thank thee, Balthilda.... I am not hungry. I thank thee. (_Silence_.
Balthilda _stands and looks tearfully at him_.)

How much food do we have left? I'm beginning to worry.
<===>
Don't you understand, dear? I believe I could become of some
use in the office. And in that way, you know, we might begin afresh--and
try, with God's help, to pay your creditors.

Father, forgive me for all that
I have neglected to do! You shall see how I will try and make up for it!
How hard I shall work!

[_Disturbed_.] My dear Miss Marie, I do not understand the reason for
your agitation, and I will not question you! But of your struggles--you
shall know that you have a friend near you, on whom you can rely, now
and for all time to come. Marie, I don't know how to express myself;
but I desire to shield and protect you all your life--I will worship
you----

Pastor, do you know who and what I am?
<===>
What do you say? Am I not your father? How do you know that?
Who told you that? And who is your father, then? Who?

Look! Is that a shaft of light I see?

Do not cry out.... Do not cry out so.... Come, we will open the
shutters.... You cannot see here. Alladine!... She is already sitting
up. Alladine, come too.... Do you see, my children, it is dark in
the room. It is as dark here as if we were a thousand feet under the
ground. But I open one of the shutters, and behold! All the light of
the sky and the sun!... It does not need much effort; the light
is full of good-will.... It suffices that one call it; it always
obeys.... Have you seen the river with its little islands between the
meadows in flower?... The sky is a crystal ring to-day.... Alladine!
Palomides, come see.... Draw both of you near Paradise.... You must
kiss each other in the new light.... I bear you no ill-will. You did
what was ordained; and so did I.... Lean out a moment from the open
window, and look once more at the sweet green things....
                       [_A silence. He closes the shutter without a word_.]

_Vast subterranean crypts_. ALLADINE _and_ PALOMIDES.

And dark?

Dark and dirty.
<===>
And dark?

Hooray! We've escaped!
<===>
If I could only escape seeing him!

Yes, you must stay in the house.
<===>
The very reason why I must go straight ahead, for once in my
life! No, I must stay here now.--Well, good morning, uncle! I must go
out for a turn.

Falk, you mean.
<===>
What mean you?
