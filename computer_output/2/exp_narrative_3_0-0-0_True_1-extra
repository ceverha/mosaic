I can't believe you threw that ball over the fence. Now you're going to have to go into that dark, scary, spooky forest all by yourself!
<===>
[Violently.] Well, living with you is enough to drive anyone off
their nut. Your bunk about the farm being so fine! Didn't I write you
year after year how rotten it was and what a dirty slave them cousins
made of me? What'd you care? Nothing! Not even enough to come out and
see me! That crazy bull about wanting to keep me away from the sea
don't go down with me! You yust didn't want to be bothered with me!
You're like all the rest of 'em!

[Feebly.] Anna! It ain't so--
<===>
It made me horribly uneasy.

Why didn't you tell me? I'd have put it down at once.
<===>
You make me ill when you talk that way, Eileen.
It doesn't sound like you at all. What's come over you lately? Get a
grip on yourself, for God's sake. I was--knocked out--when I read the
note you slipped me after supper. I didn't get a chance to read it
until late, I was so busy packing, and by that time you'd gone to your
cottage. If I could have reached you any way I'd have refused to come
here, I tell you straight. But I couldn't--and I knew you'd be here
waiting--and--still, I feel guilty. Damn it, this isn't the thing for
you! You ought to be in bed asleep. Can't you look out for yourself?

Hurry up! You're making me worried. [hears scream] What was that? Hold on!
<===>
Wait till you read the others I'm going to do!
(_After a slight pause--with a good-natured grin._) Here I am talking
about myself again! Why don't you call me down when I start that
drivel? But you don't know how good it is to have your dreams coming
true. It'd make an egotist out of anyone.

No. I don't know. But I love to hear you talk of
yours.
<===>
Yes, you have. I know what you all think of me. Dont imagine I'm
sore about it. I forgive you.

That was old Walpole, I know. Don't grieve, Walpole. I'm
perfectly happy. I'm not in pain. I don't want to live. Ive escaped from
myself. I'm in heaven, immortal in the heart of my beautiful Jennifer.
I'm
<===>
Oh, I'm not crying! I'm master of this house! I know what
I've got to do! Poor cripple has his honor, too. Think I'll stand for
it! My daughter! She'll see! (_Swinging the poker_) I'll give her my
curse! My paternal curse!

It hurts so much, make it stop!
<===>
want to so much. If it won’t bore you. It would make me so
happy.

Go on.
<===>
Go on, go on.

know I oughtn’t to mind, but I haven’t always been so poor. We
were well off before my husband fell ill, and I’ve always lived by my
own work. It’s not as it is for a woman who hasn’t any self-respect.
<===>
I have never been treated like this in my life. Here am I, a
married man, with a most attractive wife: a wife I adore, and who
adores me, and has never as much as looked at any other man since we
were married. I come and throw all this at your feet. I! I, a
solicitor! braving the risk of your husband putting me into the divorce
court and making me a beggar and an outcast! I do this for your sake.
And you go on as if I were making no sacrifice: as if I had told you
it's a fine evening, or asked you to have a cup of tea. It's not human.
It's not right. Love has its rights as well as respectability [he sits
down again, aloof and sulky].

Be quiet. 
<===>
Be quiet, mother!

You are much too cross!
<===>
You are too cross.

The young side with the young.

And Dorf, the actor, and his wife were in the company. All
the young men in the town were infatuated with her.
