A:
	How are you doing today? I haven't seen you in a while.

B:
	Do you like me best as I am?

A:
	Is there then no hope for me?

B:
	You are in good spirits to-day, Commander. You are positively
brilliant. What is the matter?

A:

B:
	[Softly, to HEMMING, who has been whispering with
INGEBORG.]  Well, Hemming!  How do you think your master is
disposed?

A:
	Oh, she aint in a hurry: she doesnt mind how long she waits. [She
goes out].

B:
	This time it was an accident, though. (Looks at
him.) How pale you are!
