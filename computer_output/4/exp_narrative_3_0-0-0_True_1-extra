I can't believe you threw that ball over the fence. Now you're going to have to go into that dark, scary, spooky forest all by yourself!
<===>
(_roughly_) 'Right to you!' And that's all you know of
adventure--and of anguish. Do you know it is you--world of which you're
so true a flower--makes me have to leave? You're there to hold the door
shut! Because you're young and of a gayer world, you think I can't _see_
them--those old men? Do you know why you're so sure of yourself? Because
you can't _feel_. Can't feel--the limitless--out there--a sea just over
the hill. I will not stay with you! (_buries her hands in the earth
around the Edge Vine. But suddenly steps back from it as she had from_
ELIZABETH) And I will not stay with _you! (grasps it as we grasp what we
would kill, is trying to pull it up. They all step forward in horror.

Miss Claire! Miss Claire! The work of years!
<===>
But come and see, Miss Claire.

It's so much more than--I'd see.
<===>
As much more.

Hurry up! You're making me worried. [hears scream] What was that? Hold on!
<===>
Then theres nothing more to worry about, is there? Give me some
more of that milk. I'm fearfully tired; but if I stop talking I shant
begin again. [Sir Ralph gives him a drink. He takes it and looks up
quaintly]. I say, B. B., do you think anything would stop you talking?

Yes, dear?
<===>
Dear me!

I am afraid, my dear Mrs. Riis, we have
come at an inconvenient time for your daughter?
<===>
No, thank you; don't trouble. And you must not be
offended at my coming to fetch my husband; I am the mother of three
children, you know.

It hurts so much, make it stop!
<===>
want to so much. If it wonâ€™t bore you. It would make me so
happy.

Go on.
<===>
Go on! Go on!

Well, as I said, it's simple enough. The Herr Councillor was
here.
<===>
Well--but when all is said and done, you know--this was only a book--

Be quiet.

Be quiet, down there!

He made me promise that, on the day on which his daughter was to
be presented at the palace as the King's betrothed, I would stand up

He made me promise that, on the day on which his daughter was to
be presented at the palace as the King's betrothed, I would stand up
in some public place where she would pass by, and say that it was being
done against her father's will and in spite of his urgent entreaties and
commands. (Loud cries of "Bravo!" from the club. A voice in the crowd:
"That is just what we thought!") I am charged to announce publicly that
he despises her for it and sends her his curse! (Fresh cries of "Bravo!"
from the club. Voices in the crowd: "That's shocking!"--"No, he was
quite right;" etc., etc. Uproar.) Quiet, good people!

May I be allowed to ask a question? (Shouts of
"Yes!" and "No!" and laughter are heard.)
<===>
[With bitter mockery.]  You shall not be able to
say that you acted over hastily.  Good opportunity you had, so
far as I can remember, to stop and consider; you stood outside
there, no one came near you, no one prevented you from
deliberating as calmly as you could.  Nor shall you say that the
merriment of the festive occasion went to your head, nor that the
wine distracted you; for you were not on the inside at all; you
stood on the outside, and it was cool enough there,--the biting
wind should have made you sober.
