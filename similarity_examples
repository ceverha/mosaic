Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen somethins so exquisite.
|
Yes I have. There is something very touching about the history of this beautiful girl.

Beau--! Oho! Here's a chance for Nora! and for me! [Calling] Hodson.
|
I cannot spend the night in a strange man's room.

I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.
|
Oh really, father! Miss! Is that the way to talk to a widow?

Is that the way to talk to a father? Your marriage was absolutely a most disatrous imprudence. It gave you habits that are absolutely beyond your means--I mean beyond my means: you have no means. Why did you not marry Matthews: the best curate I ever had?

[_Somewhat aroused. he gets up and walks to and fro while he is speaking._] I don't think evil of women.--Not a bit!--I think evil only of marrying ... of marriage ... of marriage and--at most, of men ... the woman question, you think, has ceased to interest me? What do you suppose I've worked here for, during six years, like a cart horse? Surely in order to devote at last all the power that is in me to the solution of that question. Didn't you know that from the beginning?

You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.
|
You have had enough in hearing the one, I imagine. Do you know when I heard Mrs. Alving eulogizing her dead husband, I thought to myself what a damned pity it was fellow was dead. Do you suppose that he would have spoken if he had been alive? And do you suppose that if any of the dead husbands came back they would be believed? Good night, Doctor. you see that I am calm, and you can retire without fear.

Good night, then, Captain. I'm afraid. I can be of no further use in this case.
|
I'll do my best.

With you dead, what keeps me alive?
|
So he is alive still.

I thought he was travelling with a theatrical company?
|
And surely I have heard that a touring theatrical company came here, too?
