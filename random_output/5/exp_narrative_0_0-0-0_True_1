A:
	Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.

B:
	I don't want to get shut of you. I want to keep you here
and save your soul. You'd better stay: you're going to have a bad
time today, Bill.

A:
	Come to the fowl. I wish it was as big as a pig; a fowl with goose
grease and pig’s crackling.

B:
	No, nor mine either. It was seventeen years ago, when
our boss on the avenue got his title of Councillor of Commerce--there
was a great time: carriages and fireworkings and free beer for all the
workmen in the factory. Well, my husband was a little bit full--and why
not?--Pa, quit pounding! when it didn't cost nothing? Well, one of the
carriages run over him,--broke his leg and his arm!

A:
	I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.

B:
	He get dizzy! No, I know quite well he does not!

A:
	I know that. The engine master has left. He's reached the engine long
ago.

B:
	Still, even the soundest have their anxious moments.

A:
	You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.

B:
	[_Appears in the doorway._] You're to come right over, Glasenapp. His
honour wants to ax you somethin'.

A:
	Oh—mustn’t I? Go along! _He’s_ right.

B:
	Heredity again ! It was then that we looked in the 
face — that we sadly but heroically accepted — our re- 
sponsibilities to our little incumbrance: not with the 
vain hope of making him what his brother would have 
been, but with that of repressing his inchnations.

A:
	With you dead, what keeps me alive?

B:
	[fondly, to his great terror] I don't want to remind you of
anything. But I knew the people they happened to, and heard about them.

A:
	Well, you don't need to say nothin' but that here neither. Only say it
right out strong an' sure. You ain't such a mouse other times.

B:
	Here, here!
