	How are you doing today? I haven't seen you in a while.

	Now please do stop fooling, Meg. I tell you I'm not rotting. [He

A:
	See! I'm back again, little girls! (He enters through the garden

B:

throwing. You didn't expect anything like that, did you?

A:
	Really? Now that's hard to believe. 

B:
	It is railway carriages that we are discussing.

A:
	Try a whisky and soda.

B:
	But--

A:
	It's all about finding the balance.

B:

A:
	Grandmother doesn't tell lies.

B:
	Oh, don't think about that ancient history.

A:
	That is surprising - I never thought about it like that before.

B:
	Your play is very hard to act; there are no living characters in
it.

A:
	I do not, Lady Hunstanton.  I think there are many
things women should never forgive.

B:
	The rascal had tried his hand!
