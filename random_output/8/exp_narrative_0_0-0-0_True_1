A:
	Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.

B:
	{Looking at her with a queer look.} I heard tell this day, Nora
Burke, that it was on the path below Patch Darcy would be passing up and
passing down, and I heard them say he'ld never past it night or morning
without speaking with yourself.

A:
	What good is that to me if everybody will know what woman it was?

B:
	Ah, yes, that's the way it sounded when they came to take
father away--and then I became ill.--And now they are coming to take me.

A:
	I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.

B:
	Good heavens! What's the matter?

A:
	Come. We are engaged, as good as married. Give me one kiss.

B:
	Ah! ah! You do not flee, because you think my old hands harmless! They
have yet the strength to tear a secret out in spite of all [_He seizes
her arms_.] And they could wrestle with all those you prefer.... [_He
twists her arms behind her head_.] Ah! you will not speak!... There
will yet come a time when all your soul shall spirt out like a clear
spring, for woe....

A:
	You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.

B:
	Stand thou behind me.

A:
	You pay me too great a compliment.

B:
	In other words, you have fought a duel.

A:
	With you dead, what keeps me alive?

B:
	You have eaten it! You have told me lies. I might have known you had
eaten it when I saw your slow, sleepy walk. Lie there till the kings
come. O, I will tell Conchubar and Cuchulain and all the kings about
you!

A:
	Yes, yes, it's mad enough of them, certainly;
but--(PETRA comes in from the sitting-room). Back from school already?

B:
	So must we all. But I mean to put it off as long as possible, I promise
you!
