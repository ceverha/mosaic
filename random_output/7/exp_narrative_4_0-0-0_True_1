A:
	Let me get this straight. You did what?

B:
	Waited? For me to come?

A:
	Excuse my intruding in this fashion, but there is no
knocker on the door and the bell does not seem to ring.

B:
	I--I hardly know him yet. He seems to be a very nice old
gentleman.

A:
	I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.

B:
	When I was alone with you here--and you had really found
yourself--

A:
	Certainly not.

B:
	[Spitefully.] It seems to me it's much more for Martha's sake,
we're urging you than for our own. After all, the town can't say
anything against us.

A:
	Get out! GET OUT!

B:
	Not a soul in Ch√¢teauneuf must know what has happened.
Fortunately we have a little time.

A:
	[_Modestly._] Mother, how'd it be if I was to open the window jus' a
speck an' was to light my pipe for a bit?

B:
	No, they are found in real life too.

A:
	I don't care. Don't speak to me again.

B:
	You've taken it out of me, you beast!

A:
	Oh, love me always, Gertrude, love me always!

B:
	God knows I would sooner some one else did it! But none can do it
so fitly as I--because no one else has loved you as I have. I expected
too much of you, you say? The only thing I wanted of you was that you
should be faithful! I had so often been disappointed; but in you and
your quiet strength I thought I had splendid security that, as long as
you lived, our cause would bear itself proudly and confidently. It was
your prestige that brought it into being; your wealth that supported it.
It did not cry aloud for the blood of martyrs!--You were the happiness
of my life; my soul renewed its strength from yours.
