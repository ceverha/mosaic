A:
	How are you doing today? I haven't seen you in a while.

B:
	I cannot tell.

A:
	To let me alone. (As she leaves the door.) 1 askcd you that, 
you know, at Courtlands.

B:
	Mr. John isn't here. What do you want, Selma?

A:
	Really? Now that's hard to believe. 

B:
	I blame nobody. But let him not think he can walk by his own
light. I tell him that if he gives up being respectable he'll go right
down to the bottom of the hill. He has no powers inside himself to keep
him steady; so let him cling to the powers outside him.

A:
	She is far too stupid to think of such a thing.

B:
	I did not mean that. I meant afraid of my taking the law into
my own hands, and killing you.

A:
	It's all about finding the balance.

B:
	Wake, Joyzelle....

A:
	[As if in desperation.] Ragnar--you must not ask me to do what is beyond
my power! Do you hear, Ragnar? You must not!

B:
	Your what?

A:
	That is surprising - I never thought about it like that before.

B:
	Yes, here they are.

A:
	Oh!  Wicked women bother one.  Good women bore one.  That
is the only difference between them.

B:
	How do you do? [She sits down on the ottoman gracefully in the
place just left vacant by Higgins].
