A:
	Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.

B:
	(_as her head appears_) Well, these stairs should keep down
weight. You missed an awfully good dinner, Claire. And kept Mr Edgeworth
from a good dinner.

A:
	That is all there is here!

B:
	God shield me--you would--!

A:
	I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.

B:
	The sound of the loom.

A:
	Aha! So he _was_ here! I confess that I am very curious. I hope that it
was his intention to come back?

B:
	I don't.

A:
	You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.

B:
	Where is the use of herbs, and his teeth clenched the way he could not
use them?

A:
	No, we had our dinner in the open air, we two.

B:
	It sounds such a ludicrous little thing; for, you see, the whole story
turns upon nothing but a crack in the chimney.

A:
	With you dead, what keeps me alive?

B:
	I don't hardly believe ...

A:
	Well, you know, all the boys down at the beach can swim. I am the
only one that can't.

B:
	Dear Mamma, he has come back for you.
