A:
	Let me get this straight. You did what?

B:
	I see, Claire.

A:
	Yes, I know, your Excellency. You mean Meixner.

B:
	Couldn't be more pleasant, I must
say--light and airy. (_He walks to where he can take a peep into the
dining-room._) Ah, they're all at breakfast, I see.

A:
	I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.

B:
	[Advancing toward the table--protesting to BURKE.] No! You don't
do dat, you! You tal him you don't vant for hear him talk, Anna.

A:
	FALK.
                              There's a plucky lass!

B:
	[looking round carefully to make sure that Tavy is not within
earshot] No.

A:
	Get out! GET OUT!

B:
	What! My dear Miss Engstrand! When the man is your own father!

A:
	No, no, how could I? Don't speak of it!

B:
	Your uncle's danger. Major Swindon's gallows.

A:
	I don't care. Don't speak to me again.

B:
	Haven't I felt that!

A:
	I thought you'd be out on the canal by this time.

B:
	I've been preparing too.
