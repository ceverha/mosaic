A:
	I can't believe you threw that ball over the fence. Now you're going to have to go into that dark, scary, spooky forest all by yourself!

B:
	Have you got it with you, Mr. Mayor?

A:
	It shall be devoted to a worthy one !

B:
	Yes--personal peculiarities, and things like that, which after
all are only excrescences; but not on points that concern one's moral
growth.

A:
	Hurry up! You're making me worried. [hears scream] What was that? Hold on!

B:
	To become his wife, Mr. Rorlund. And I will add more. (In a
low voice, to his wife.) Betty, be strong to bear what is coming.
(Aloud.) This is what I have to say: hats off to that man, for he has
nobly taken another's guilt upon his shoulders. My friends, I want to
have done with falsehood; it has very nearly poisoned every fibre of my
being. You shall know all. Fifteen years ago, I was the guilty man.

A:
	But I am to desert her, I suppose.

B:
	My Uncle Phil was a teetotaller. My father used to say to me:
Rob, he says, dont you ever have a weakness. If you find one getting a
hold on you, make a merit of it, he says. Your Uncle Phil doesnt like
spirits; and he makes a merit of it, and is chairman of the Blue Ribbon
Committee. I do like spirits; and I make a merit of it, and I'm the King
Cockatoo of the Convivial Cockatoos. Never put yourself in the wrong, he
says. I used to boast about what a good boy Bobby was. Now I swank about
what a dog he is; and it pleases people just as well. What a world it
is!

A:
	It hurts so much, make it stop!

B:
	                 My boy, my son,
    I'd give my heart's blood for thy happiness.
    Thwart thee, my son! Ah, no. I'll go with thee.
    I'll brave the dews. I'll sacrifice my sleep.
    I am old--no matter: ne'er shall it be said
    Mellish deserted thee.

A:
	rather think so.

B:
	That has nothing to do with the charge against you.

A:
	Be quiet. 

B:
	It'll go wrong--m--If you call the doctor, dear Miss Helen,--m--it will
surely go wrong!

A:
	Yes, it does; and this one deals with the future.

B:
	In another minute it’s going to be all my fault! I was glad
she should go to their house because I thought old Bernin might be
useful to us. How should I know that the girl couldn’t behave herself?
