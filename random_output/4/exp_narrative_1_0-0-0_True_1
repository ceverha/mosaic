A:
	We are lost in this cave. How much more battery power do we have left?

B:
	I like him best when he is howling.

A:
	No.

B:
	She wanted to sleep.

A:
	How much food do we have left? I'm beginning to worry.

B:
	He sailed in a ship to the north.

A:
	Henschel, I'd better leave you alone now. But when it's agreeable to
you--to-morrow maybe, I'd like to talk over some business with you.

B:
	We have sworn the oath of foster-brothers.

A:
	Look! Is that a shaft of light I see?

B:
	Yes, here with you, mother.

A:
	[Shaking his head.] Now my dear Mrs. Hedda, how could you do such a
thing? To the excellent old lady, too!

B:
	Now that I've had my eyes opened, the past is beginning to take on
another color. It seems to me almost as if you conjured that courtship
of ours; it seems almost as if I had been the victim of what you women
call seduction; it now seems to me as if I had fallen into the hands of
an adventuress, who lured my money away from me in a _h√¥tel garni_; it
seems almost as if I had lived in vice ever since I was united with you!
[Rising.] And now, as you stand there with your back turned to me and
I see your neck with your short hair, it is--yes, it is exactly as
if--ugh!--as if you were Judith and had given your body to be able to
behead me! Look, there is the dress I was going to wear, that you wished
to humiliate me with. Yes, you felt that it was debasing to wear those
things, and thought it disguised your desire to irritate,--this low-cut
bodice and the corsets which were to advertise your woman's wares. No,
I return your love-token and shake off the fetters. [He throws down the
wedding-ring. Bertha looks at him in wonderment. Axel pushes back his
hair.] You didn't want to see that my forehead is higher than yours, so
I let my hair conceal it, so as not to humble and frighten you. But now
I am going to humble you, and since you were not willing to be my equal
when I lowered myself to your level, you shall be my inferior, which you
are.

A:
	Hooray! We've escaped!

B:
	[_Turning around on his stool._] What the devil is
that--someone knocking? [_Shouts:_] Come in, why don't you? [_All the
men in the room look up. YANK opens the door slowly, gingerly, as if
afraid of an ambush. He looks around for secret doors, mystery, is
taken aback by the commonplaceness of the room and the men in it,
thinks he may have gotten in the wrong place, then sees the signboard
on the wall and is reassured._]

A:
	Whew! The regiment won't like that, I can tell you.

B:
	Don't you think we should leave politics out of the question?
