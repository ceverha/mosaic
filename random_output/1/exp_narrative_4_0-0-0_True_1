A:
	Let me get this straight. You did what?

B:
	[Shocked.] Good heavens!

A:
	Like a snake that crept out when I went to sleep. An' it tormented me an'
wound itself aroun' me an' squeezed me so that I screamed right out an'
my landlady found me lyin' on the bare floor jus' like somebody what's
dead.

B:
	 I dont know.  Whats that got to do with you?

A:
	I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.

A:
	What d'ye want now?

B:
	[As if she suddenly has an idea.]  But in case

A:
	I don't care. Don't speak to me again.

B:
	Goodbye, Hesione. I'm very sorry. I see now that it sounds very
improbable as I tell it. But I can't stay if you think that way about
me.

A:
	I gets my pay into my hand--here--that's where!

B:
	To that too.
