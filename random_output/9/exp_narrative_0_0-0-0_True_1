A:
	Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.

B:
	Oh yes I do. I like working and getting paid for it. When Iâ€™m
tired of working, I like a comfortable chair, a cigar, a little whisky,
and a novel with a good detective story in it.

A:
	Tell me, is it reasonable to think that one can see what is
happening on another planet by looking through a microscope?

B:
	Ice of life indeed! You should be eating penny ices and
enjoying yourself. I wont hear another word.

A:
	I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.

B:
	Yes, that's what he says.

A:
	King ... my mother ... taught me ... (_She stops_.)

B:
	Do's I tell you an' don't answer back.

A:
	You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.

B:
	Oh, look out of the door and tell me if there is anybody there in the
street. I cannot leave this glass; somebody might shake it! Then the
sand would fall more quickly.

A:
	Oh, I tried to become reconciled. I tried my damnedest. I tried
to love this child as I had loved those that died. But I couldn't. And
so, this being estranged us. We loved as intensely as ever but IT
pushed us apart. I grew to dread the idea of this intruder. She saw
this in me. I denied it--but she knew. There was something in each of
us the other grew to hate. And still we loved as never before, perhaps,
for we grew to pity each other's helplessness.

B:
	Excuse me--only eight months.

A:
	With you dead, what keeps me alive?

B:
	Even you are not rich enough, Sir Robert, to buy back
your past.  No man is.

A:
	 I wont be bullied by you.  _[Percival makes a threatening
step towards him]._  Police!  _[He tries to bolt; but Percival seizes
him]._  Leave me go, will you?  What right have you to lay hands on
me?

B:
	Let you not be whispering sin, Martin Doul, or maybe it's the
finger of God they'd see pointing to ourselves.
