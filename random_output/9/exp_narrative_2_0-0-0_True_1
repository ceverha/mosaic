A:
	How are you doing today? I haven't seen you in a while.

B:
	One moment. (The waiter stops, with a sinking heart.) My father
was a witness of what passed to-day, was he not, Mrs. Clandon?

A:
	Yes, they are singing across the water. [A pause.]

B:
	[Detains him.]  One moment, Catiline!

A:
	Really? Now that's hard to believe. 

B:
	Oh no, Lady Caroline.  I have only had one husband as yet.
I suppose you look upon me as quite an amateur.

A:
	And in me canst thou trust, as in one of thine own blood.

B:
	Sire, may I not offer thee the food, and the wine?

A:
	It's all about finding the balance.

B:
	But you will need to--

A:
	There may'st thou see his warships; we are at one--do thou
go with him.

B:
	What is lying, and what is truth? But your resignation from
the Stock Exchange Committee and your subsequent failure to be elected
to any public position will be no lies, I can assure you! Public opinion
is not to be trifled with, you know!

A:
	That is surprising - I never thought about it like that before.

B:
	You won’t give me any idea?

A:
	Come, Rufio.

B:
	Oh no, no, Lancéor, you have not lost me!...
