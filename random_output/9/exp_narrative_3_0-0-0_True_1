A:
	I can't believe you threw that ball over the fence. Now you're going to have to go into that dark, scary, spooky forest all by yourself!

B:
	Please, please. We have many very serious matters to discuss.

A:
	That is to say, you put eight in your pocket. Then you have
received three hundred francs for the picture that you sold.

B:
	That's it! Yessir! They says that Selma pushed the perambulator with her
little brother in here where the strange girl an' her friend came an'
took him an' carried him off. But upstairs, in the actor's place, they
caught her.

A:
	Hurry up! You're making me worried. [hears scream] What was that? Hold on!

B:
	No Gothic man doeth that, King!

A:
	The grave-vault!  (To himself.)  No matter, he
_must_ be saved!

B:
	You seem very tired.

A:
	It hurts so much, make it stop!

B:
	Give me the head of Jokanaan.

A:
	How would you do it? Come, explain.

B:
	Yes, that is another thing. The burden on the poor
rates has been lightened, to the great relief of the propertied
classes; and that relief will be even greater if only we get a really
good summer this year, and lots of visitors--plenty of invalids, who
will make the Baths talked about.

A:
	Be quiet. 

B:
	[Outside.] Yes, Mrs. Alving?

A:
	[Laughing loudly, to IVANOFF] Why don't you send this Judas
packing?

B:
	No.
