B:
	Queen of the Gypsies, you mean.

A:
	It's all about finding the balance.

B:
	The English ship! Is she in sight already?

A:
	Did Holtzmann do as well as you expected?

B:
	(A pause.) If we are to assist the sound firms and
leave the others to their fate, the best way will certainly be for all
alike to disclose their actual position.
