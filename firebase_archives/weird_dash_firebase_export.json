I wanted to marry you\nand fool you, but I couldn't. Don't you see how I'd changed? I couldn't\nmarry you with you believing a lie--and I was shamed to tell you the\ntruth--till the both of you forced my hand, and I seen you was the same\nas all the rest. And now, give me a bawling out and beat it, like I can\ntell you're going to. [She stops, looking at BURKE. He is silent, his\nface averted, his features beginning to work with fury.

All our playful misogyny was just some filmy facade designed to hide our deep homoerotic longing for one another? Chad, I can't believe this! You know what this means?\n\nA:\n\tThere was your mistake.  There was your error.  The\nerror all women commit.  Why can’t you women love us, faults and all?\nWhy do you place us on monstrous pedestals?  We have all feet of clay,\nwomen as well as men; but when we men love women, we love them knowing\ntheir weaknesses, their follies, their imperfections, love them all the\nmore, it may be, for that reason.  It is not the perfect, but the\nimperfect, who have need of love.  It is when we are wounded by our own\nhands, or by the hands of others, that love should come to cure us—else\nwhat use is love at all?  All sins, except a sin against itself, Love\nshould forgive.  All lives, save loveless lives, true Love should pardon.\nA man’s love is like that.  It is wider, larger, more human than a\nwoman’s.  Women think that they are making ideals of men.  What they are\nmaking of us are false idols merely.  You made your false idol of me, and\nI had not the courage to come down, show you my wounds, tell you my\nweaknesses.  I was afraid that I might lose your love, as I have lost it\nnow.  And so, last night you ruined my life for me—yes, ruined it!  What\nthis woman asked of me was nothing compared to what she offered to me.\nShe offered security, peace, stability.  The sin of my youth, that I had\nthought was buried, rose up in front of me, hideous, horrible, with its\nhands at my throat.  I could have killed it for ever, sent it back into\nits tomb, destroyed its record, burned the one witness against me.  You\nprevented me.  No one but you, you know it.  And now what is there before\nme but public disgrace, ruin, terrible shame, the mockery of the world, a\nlonely dishonoured life, a lonely dishonoured death, it may be, some day?\nLet women make no more ideals of men! let them not put them on alters and\nbow before them, or they may ruin other lives as completely as you—you\nwhom I have so wildly loved—have ruined mine!\n\nB:\n\t[B pulls A into a deep, passionate kiss, stopping his mouth. Their lips separate slowly; their eyes find something precious, fragile, hidden in each other. Then, B finds the courage to speak.] I love you too, bro. Let's get out of here.\n",
