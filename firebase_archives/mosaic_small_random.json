You would all have grown up without principles, without\nany knowledge of right and wrong, if he had been in the house.\nYou know, my dear, your father was a very attractive man in some\nways. Children did not dislike him; and he took advantage of it\nto put the wickedest ideas into their heads, and make them quite\nunmanageable. I did not dislike him myself: very far from it; but\nnothing can bridge over moral disagreement.\n\nA:\n\tLook! Is that a shaft of light I see?\n\nB:\n\tGentlemen, my daughter. [They all bow].
