	Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.

JILL:
	And so he makes
something beautiful...

JACK:
	You sure were beautiful.

JILL:
	I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.

JACK:
	I know It by heart.

JILL:
	I have heart disease.
-Is something wrong with your heart?

JACK:
	You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.

JILL:
	A man has been killed on this ship
for the first time. I want to know why.

JACK:
	We know you two fellows
know one another,

JILL:
	With you dead, what keeps me alive?

JACK:
	Am I dead or alive? Or am I sick?

JILL:
	Dead means dead. You're both dead.
