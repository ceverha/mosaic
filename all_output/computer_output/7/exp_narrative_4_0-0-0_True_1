A:
	Let me get this straight. You did what?

B:
	You can depend on me.

A:
	That wouldn't do. Remember you are married now.

B:
	--a criminal, an imbecile or a horror. You said that before.
(Sits down beside him with a fling.)

A:
	I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.

B:
	But you promised me faithfully.

A:
	Thank you, thank you.  I will make a point of repeating
it.

B:
	Think over what?

A:
	Get out! GET OUT!

B:
	Rest easy, little one--you do.

A:
	(_Shakes his head_) If Herr Muhlingk, Junior, sends word, or
comes himself, call me. (_He goes off_)

B:
	_Langen-Bielau,--OLD WEAVER HILSE'S workroom. On the left a small
    window, in front of which stands the loom. On the right a bed, with a
    table pushed close to it.

A:
	I don't care. Don't speak to me again.

B:
	Believe me, you are mistaken about this, Miss Valborg. You
don't see things as plainly as I do.

A:
	But surely you can do as you please without injuring anyone,
Mrs. Juno. That is the whole secret of your extraordinary charm for me.

B:
	[Trembling with rage.] I--I begin to think--you--all of
you--are aiming at something against Martha in this. Yes--in back of
your words--your actions--I begin to feel--[Raging.] Go away! Get out
of this house--all of you!
