Similarity pairs

We are lost in this cave. How much more battery power do we have left?
<===>
What a strange woman you are,
Katherine! Would you prefer to have the boys grow up in a society like
this? You saw for yourself last night that half the population are out
of their minds; and if the other half have not lost their senses, it is
because they are mere brutes, with no sense to lose.

But, Thomas dear, the imprudent things you said had
something to do with it, you know.
<===>
Yes I am. Since you saw me for the first time in that
garden, you've heard me say nothing clever. And I've heard you say
nothing that didn't make me laugh, or make me feel friendly, as well
as telling me what to think and what to do. That's what I mean by real
cleverness. Well, I haven't got it. I can give an order when I know what
order to give. I can make men obey it, willing or unwilling. But I'm
stupid, I tell you: stupid. When there's no Gordon to command me, I
can't think of what to do. Left to myself, I've become half a brigand.
I can kick that little gutterscrub Drinkwater; but I find myself doing
what he puts into my head because I can't think of anything else. When
you came, I took your orders as naturally as I took Gordon's, though
I little thought my next commander would be a woman. I want to take
service under you. And there's no way in which that can be done except
marrying you. Will you let me do it?

I'm afraid you don't quite know how odd a match it would be
for me according to the ideas of English society.
<===>
Of course!--if only this obstinate little person can get her
way! Do you suppose I am going to make myself ridiculous before my whole
staff, to let people think that I am a man to be swayed by all sorts of
outside influence? I should very soon feel the consequences of it, I can
tell you! And besides, there is one thing that makes it quite impossible
for me to have Krogstad in the Bank as long as I am manager.

How much food do we have left? I'm beginning to worry.
<===>
Don't you understand, dear? I believe I could become of some
use in the office. And in that way, you know, we might begin afresh--and
try, with God's help, to pay your creditors.

Father, forgive me for all that
I have neglected to do! You shall see how I will try and make up for it!
How hard I shall work!
<===>
If I wish you to save him!... But do you not see that, if you were
to hesitate, do you not know that, if for his sake, I had to.... No,
no, I meant to say ... my distress bewilders me.... He has ceased to
breathe, I no longer hear his heart.... You seem to me so slow!...
Do you think that there is no danger, no need for haste?... I will
speak no more; I am making you lose minutes which perhaps were
passing to save him.... If you will not help him yourself--and I can
understand that, for you do not love him--tell me only what I must do
to assist him; and I shall know how to do it.... But I can see, I am
sure that he cannot wait and that we must make haste....

I have told you, Joyzelle, his life is in my hands and cannot escape
without my consent. I warned you of it. The poison is doing its work
and I can see it.
<===>
Lancéor! Lancéor!... He cannot hear me.... His eyes are wide open....
Lancéor, I am here, I am bending over your eyes.... Look at me, look
at me!... No, he does not see me!... Lancéor, for pity's sake!...
If your voice is too weak, give a sign of life!... I take you in my
arms, my arms that love you!... Come, come, come to yourself, in
our great love!... See, see, it is my hands that are lifting your
head.... Do you recognize my hands, as they stroke your hair?... You
so often told me, when we were happy, that the least caress of these
dear hands would recall your soul, even from the greatest happiness
of paradise, from the greatest darkness in the depths of.... No, no,
it is not there!... But his head is drooping, his arm falls back
lifeless and his fingers seem to me colder than this marble....
(_Mechanically feeling one of the columns of the bed._) No, it is
not that.... But I must know.... And his eyes are no longer....
(_Raising his head._) Is it his or mine that are so dim?... No, it
is impossible!... No, no, I will not have it! Ah, I will open your
lips!... (_She places her lips on LANCÉOR'S._) Lancéor! Lancéor! All
the ardour of my life shall enter your heart!... Do not fear, do not
fear! It is the saving flame and life that restores life!... Breathe
it all in the last efforts of my breath which loves you!... I would
gladly suffocate in exchanging my life for yours!... I give you my
strength, my hours, my years!... Here they are, here they are!...
You have but to make a movement, to open your lips!... It must be
so!... It must be possible thus to give new life to those whom we
love better than ourselves!... When we give them all, they cannot but
take it!... (_Raising her head to look at LANCÉOR._) He is falling
back! He is going from me!... (_Infatuated, she takes him in her arms
again._) Help!... No, this is too much!... Help! Hasten! Hasten!...
Ah no, I know better, no, no, it is not that.... Death does not
come like this when love threatens it!... No, no, I fear nothing,
no, no, I will not have it!... But I am crying for help! I cannot
remain alone, I cannot fight alone against all the strength of death
approaching!... If no one comes, it will end by conquering!... Help,
I say!... You must come to my aid!... Life must help me, or it is no
longer possible and we shall succumb!...

Look! Is that a shaft of light I see?
<===>
Do not cry out.... Do not cry out so.... Come, we will open the
shutters.... You cannot see here. Alladine!... She is already sitting
up. Alladine, come too.... Do you see, my children, it is dark in
the room. It is as dark here as if we were a thousand feet under the
ground. But I open one of the shutters, and behold! All the light of
the sky and the sun!... It does not need much effort; the light
is full of good-will.... It suffices that one call it; it always
obeys.... Have you seen the river with its little islands between the
meadows in flower?... The sky is a crystal ring to-day.... Alladine!
Palomides, come see.... Draw both of you near Paradise.... You must
kiss each other in the new light.... I bear you no ill-will. You did
what was ordained; and so did I.... Lean out a moment from the open
window, and look once more at the sweet green things....
                       [_A silence. He closes the shutter without a word_.]

_Vast subterranean crypts_. ALLADINE _and_ PALOMIDES.
<===>
Would that the world were mine to give it you
    With every quiet hearth and barren waste,
    The maddening freedom of its woods and tides,
    And the bewildering light upon its hills.

Then I would take and break it in my hands
    To see you smile watching it crumble away.
<===>
There, there--get up! Sit on the footstool!--There--(_She sits
on the stool_) and straighten up, so I can see your eyes. (_Tries to
lift her head, but she hides it in her lap_) You won't! Well, cry then!
I won't send you away from here--and you will cry for many a day and
many a night when you really understand what you have done! Tell me,
you realize, don't you, that all the rest of your life must be
repentance?

Hooray! We've escaped!
<===>
If I could only escape seeing him!

Yes, you must stay in the house.
<===>
You'll get over that. If you're going up to the house,
may I ask how long you're goin to stay there? Because if you mean to
put in the whole morning talkin to the ladies, I'll put the car in the
stables and make myself comfortable. If not, I'll keep the car on the go
about here til you come.

Better wait here. We shan't be long. There's a young American
gentleman, a Mr Malone, who is driving Mr Robinson down in his new
American steam car.
<===>
But, my dear, Doolan's a publican: a most influential
man. By the way, I asked him if his wife would be at home
tomorrow. He said she would; so you must take the motor car round
and call on her.
