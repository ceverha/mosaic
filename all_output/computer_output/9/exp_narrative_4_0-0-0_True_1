A:
	Let me get this straight. You did what?

B:
	whole lot of things; but I shall begin with the ending. We must
dissolve this concubinage.

A:
	I welcome progress too, Mr. Bernick.

B:
	So you see it would be an easy matter for me to set on foot
some testimonial, if necessary.

A:
	I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.

B:
	But you are not ready to go, Sannaes! You have not finished
your work here yet! There is what I just spoke of--and something else
that dates farther back than that.

A:
	Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Who is that pulling at my bag? King’s
son, do not pull at my bag.

B:
	There is no priest is any good at all but a spoiled priest. A one that
would take a drop of drink, it is he would have courage to face the
hosts of trouble.

A:
	Get out! GET OUT!

B:
	I’m quite serious.

A:
	Admirable!

B:
	Oh, I do. (_fervently_) I do. Harm was near, and that woke her
up.

A:
	I don't care. Don't speak to me again.

B:
	Believe me, you are mistaken about this, Miss Valborg. You
don't see things as plainly as I do.

A:
	Desdemona would have found him out if she had lived, you
know. I wonder was that why he strangled her!

B:
	[_Tossing her head_.]  It is not true.
