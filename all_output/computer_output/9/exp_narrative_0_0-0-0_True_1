	Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.

B:
	Is there anything else?

A:
	Yes.

	What do you suppose he meant just now when he said he was

B:
	What! What is it you say? (Turning.) Are you the Johnston who

A:
	You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.

B:
	He went upstairs.

A:
	Went back! But he'll return!----

B:
	You lie. I'm goin to Kennintahn, to spit in Todger
Fairmile's eye. I bashed Jenny Ill's face; and now I'll get me

A:
	[With an indulgent smile.] So you'd like to be known as a
reformed character, eh?

B:
	Good Lord! yes: I suppose so. And I thought that the days of my
vanity were past. Tell me at what age does a man leave off being a fool?
