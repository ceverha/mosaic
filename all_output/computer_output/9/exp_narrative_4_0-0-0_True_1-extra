Similarity pairs

Let me get this straight. You did what?
<===>
What have you got to tell me?

whole lot of things; but I shall begin with the ending. We must
dissolve this concubinage.
<===>
We cannot work that way now-a-days. You must not imagine,
Aune, that it is for the sake of making profit; I do not need that,
fortunately; but I owe consideration to the community I live in, and to
the business I am at the head of. I must take the lead in progress, or
there would never be any.

I welcome progress too, Mr. Bernick.
<===>
I know that quite well, Mr. Aslaksen.

I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.
<===>
You may be certain, Miss Valborg, that when I am balancing our
account you shall not suffer any injustice. But I cannot do it now. All
I have to do now is to get ready to go.

But you are not ready to go, Sannaes! You have not finished
your work here yet! There is what I just spoke of--and something else
that dates farther back than that.
<===>
Everything will be well with me. I will call my pupils; they only say
they doubt. [_Pulls the bell._] They will be here in a moment. They
want to please me; they pretend that they disbelieve. Belief is too
old to be overcome all in a minute. Besides, I can prove what I once
disproved. [_Another pull at the bell._] They are coming now. I will go
to my desk. I will speak quietly, as if nothing had happened.

Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Who is that pulling at my bag? King’s
son, do not pull at my bag.
<===>
I tell you, if you brought him tied in a bag he would not say an Our
Father for you, without you having a half-crown at the top of your
fingers.

Get out! GET OUT!
<===>
Get out!

I’m quite serious.
<===>
Quite so!

Admirable!
<===>
I see you admire her vigilance.

I don't care. Don't speak to me again.
<===>
I don't know whether I want to laugh or to cry.

Believe me, you are mistaken about this, Miss Valborg. You
don't see things as plainly as I do.
<===>
Why do you look so enigmatic about it? You are such a sphinx: I
never know what you mean.

Desdemona would have found him out if she had lived, you
know. I wonder was that why he strangled her!
<===>
I mean that you stole that ornament from my cousin, Mary
Berkshire, to whom I gave it when she was married.  Suspicion fell on a
wretched servant, who was sent away in disgrace.  I recognised it last
night.  I determined to say nothing about it till I had found the thief.
I have found the thief now, and I have heard her own confession.
