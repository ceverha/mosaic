Similarity pairs

Let me get this straight. You did what?
<===>
Go ahead. Let me know about it and I'll give you a shove so you don't
miss it.

[_Screaming._] Do I have to stand for that, that I gotta drag in two
loads o' wood at night!
<===>
Well, there we sat--you an' me--middle of a starry night, out
beside your barn. And I guess it came over you kind of funny you should
be there with me--way off the Mississippi, tryin' to save a sick horse.
Seemed to--bring your life to life again. You told me what you studied
in that fine old university you loved--the Vienna,--and why you became a
revolutionist. The old dreams took hold o' you and you talked--way you
used to, I suppose. The years, o' course, had rubbed some of it off.
Your face as you went on about the vision--you called it, vision of what
life could be. I knew that night there was things I never got wind of.
When I went away--knew I ought to go home to bed--hayin' at daybreak.
'Go to bed?' I said to myself. 'Strike this dead when you've never had
it before, may never have it again?' I climbed the hill. Blackhawk was
there.

Why, he was _dead_.
<===>
The young Syrian has slain himself! The young captain has slain
himself! He has slain himself who was my friend! I gave him a
little box of perfumes and ear-rings wrought in silver, and now
he has killed himself! Ah, did he not foretell that some
misfortune would happen? I, too, foretold it, and it has
happened. Well I knew that the moon was seeking a dead thing, but
I knew not that it was he whom she sought. Ah! why did I not hide
him from the moon? If I had hidden him in a cavern she would not
have seen him.

I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.
<===>
If you have, Mrs. Arbuthnot, pray, pray say it.  We
are quite by ourselves here.  Whatever it is, I need not say I will not
repeat it.

Mother?
<===>
My mother is living; my father is dead.

Do you miss your mother very much?
<===>
You make too much of it. My child, arenâ€™t you happy?

Get out! GET OUT!
<===>
I want to get away from them!

Rest easy, little one--you do.
<===>
You've spoiled even that chance for me. Do you think I could
look at any ordinary woman after you? You seem to be able to make me
do pretty well what you like; but you can't make me marry anybody but
yourself.

Do you know, Captain Paquito, that I've married no less
than seventeen men (Brassbound stares) to other women. And they all
opened the subject by saying that they would never marry anybody but me.
<===>
Well, if there was more than one, I am sure I know nothing about
it. No, indeed I do not! Besides, the way people gossip and backbite is
the very devil! But, as I was saying, because he dared to look at some
one before he looked at you--before he ever _thought_ of you--is that a
reason for throwing him over for good and all? How many would ever get
married under those circumstances, I should like to know? Everybody
confirms the opinion that he is an honourable, fine young fellow, to
whom the proudest girl might confidently entrust herself--you said so
yourself, only a day or two ago! Do not deny it! And now he is suddenly
to be thrown over, because you are not the first girl he has ever met!
Pride should have some limits, remember! I have never heard of anything
more preposterous, if you ask me.

I don't care. Don't speak to me again.
<===>
I don't want to, Eliza. Do you?

Not me. I don't want never to see him again, I don't. He's a
disgrace to me, he is, collecting dust, instead of working at his trade.
<===>
Everythin' else that's between us'll be settled in court. There we'll see
who's in the right. I'll get hold o' my money; never fear! Maybe you're
wife'll think it over once or twice before she goes an' perjures herself.
The rest don't concern me. I tell you to let me go. I has no time. I has
to go to Hartau, an' I can't be kept waitin' here.

What's happened here?
<===>
What happened?
