Similarity pairs

How are you doing today? I haven't seen you in a while.
<===>
You are a most accursedly attractive woman. Mind, I am not
making love to you. I do not like being attracted. But you had better
know how I feel if you are going to stay here.

You are an exceedingly clever lady-killer, Hector. And
terribly handsome. I am quite a good player, myself, at that game. Is it
quite understood that we are only playing?
<===>
I don’t think one should know of these things.  It is
not very, very nice, is it?

My dear Miss Worsley, I thought you liked English
society so much.  You were such a success in it.  And you were so much
admired by the best people.  I quite forget what Lord Henry Weston said
of you—but it was most complimentary,

of you—but it was most complimentary, and you know what an authority he
is on beauty.

Really? Now that's hard to believe. 
<===>
Really? You do believe that?

Yes, I believe it thoroughly. And so--after a few
years--when I come home again as a celebrated sculptor, and well off,
and in perfect health!
<===>
It is all right. I shall feel better after this. I have not cried
for two years. I went into the garden last night to see if our old
theatre were still standing. I see it is. I wept there for the first
time in two years, and my heart grew lighter, and my soul saw more
clearly again. See, I am not crying now. [She takes his hand in hers]
So you are an author now, and I am an actress. We have both been sucked
into the whirlpool. My life used to be as happy as a child’s; I used to
wake singing in the morning; I loved you and dreamt of fame, and what is
the reality? To-morrow morning early I must start for Eltz by train in
a third-class carriage, with a lot of peasants, and at Eltz the educated
trades-people will pursue me with compliments. It is a rough life.

Why are you going to Eltz?
<===>
What are you going to do?

It's all about finding the balance.
<===>
Most of the successful politicians nowadays have
not gained their position by means of any greatness of their own, but
by the pitiable weakness of others. Another age will form a different
estimate of them--see them in their proper perspective, and find them to
be much smaller men!

But what has that to do with us?
<===>
But what has that to do with me?

Just this much, that if I had been an ordinary stay-at-home man, a
great many things would not have happened.
<===>
I know there were a great many people who thought so.
But, in my opinion, no one would have imagined anything of the kind
from the letter. When I say the letter is a remarkable one, I mean
remarkable in quite another way.

That is surprising - I never thought about it like that before.
<===>
Perhaps it was beaver, for all I know. Anyhow, they were real proud of
it.--I admit, I laughed to myself over the business. When something like
that is discovered it always has a comic effect.

You're a cruel man, really, Doctor. I can't go an' laugh about things
like that.
<===>
What a queer creature you are, Tavy! There's no such thing as a
willing man when you really go for him. [She laughs naughtily]. I'm
shocking you, I suppose. But you know you are really getting a sort of
satisfaction already in being out of danger yourself.

Well, if it were really agony, would you ask for more of it?
<===>
Yes, a little repentance will do you good!
But it will do you no good if you obtain forgiveness easily! You want
to learn, just for once, what it is to be wounded at heart. You are only
accustomed to deal with people whom you can flog one day and have at
your feet--either from fear or from vanity--the next. And have we--God
forgive us!--ever thought seriously the worse of you for it? No; because
we never understood what it was till we were hit by it ourselves. But
that is all the more reason why we should do our duty now! Hatred shall
be met with hatred!
