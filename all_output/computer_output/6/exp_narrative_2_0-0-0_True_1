A:
	How are you doing today? I haven't seen you in a while.

B:
	You are an exceedingly clever lady-killer, Hector. And
terribly handsome. I am quite a good player, myself, at that game. Is it
quite understood that we are only playing?

A:
	My dear Miss Worsley, I thought you liked English
society so much.  You were such a success in it.  And you were so much
admired by the best people.  I quite forget what Lord Henry Weston said
of youâ€”but it was most complimentary,

B:
	Lord Henry Weston!  I remember him, Lady Hunstanton.  A man with
a hideous smile and a hideous past.  He is asked everywhere.  No
dinner-party is complete without him.

A:
	Really? Now that's hard to believe. 

B:
	Yes, I believe it thoroughly. And so--after a few
years--when I come home again as a celebrated sculptor, and well off,
and in perfect health!

A:
	Why are you going to Eltz?

B:
	Settle it. (Enter MAID.) Look here;
take this letter and go downstairs with it at once. Find a messenger and
tell him to deliver it, and be quick. The address is on it,

A:
	It's all about finding the balance.

B:
	But what has that to do with us?

A:
	Just this much, that if I had been an ordinary stay-at-home man, a
great many things would not have happened.

B:
	And what in the world did my poor wife find to write to you
about?

A:
	That is surprising - I never thought about it like that before.

B:
	You're a cruel man, really, Doctor. I can't go an' laugh about things
like that.

A:
	Well, if it were really agony, would you ask for more of it?

B:
	I think my wife is right.
