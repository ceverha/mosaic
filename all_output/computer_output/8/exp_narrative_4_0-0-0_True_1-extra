Let me get this straight. You did what?
<===>
Yes, you see how much I need it. You must coach me up to the last
minute. Promise me that, Torvald!

You can depend on me.
<===>
You can depend on me; and you know it, I think.

You know also, Mr. Johnson, I hope, that you can depend on
ME.
<===>
I know that. Well, I am going to test you--hard. Will you
believe me when I tell you that I understand what you have just told me;
that I have no desire but to serve you in the most faithful friendship;
and that your hero must be preserved to you.

I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.
<===>
I'm not. You can't call it writing--not what I
did--small town stuff. (_Changing the subject._) But I wanted to ask
you something. Do you know when I'm to be moved away to the huts?

In a few days, I guess. Don't be impatient. (Murray
_grunts and moves nervously on his chair._) What's the matter? Don't
you like us here at the Sanatorium?
<===>
[After a pause--impatiently.] Well, what next? I don't see what
good we are accomplishing. May I run along? [He gets up restlessly as
he is speaking and goes to the window.]

[Severely.] You will stay, if you please. There's to be no
shirking on anyone's part. It may take all of us to induce Curt--
<===>
You think, as I do, that we must take time to consider,
do you not? [_A pause_]. Without any definite promise on either side,
but merely in order to get rid of all money questions, which are most
distasteful to me, will you allow me to ask you one question, M. Dupont?

Get out! GET OUT!
<===>
Get out where?

(_with a bright smile_) Where you, darling, will never go.
<===>
[With a grin.] You got a half-snootful now. Where'd you get it?

[Grinning.] Oder fallar on oder barge--Irish fallar--he gat
bottle vhiskey and we drank it, yust us two. Dot vhiskey gat kick, by
yingo! Ay yust come ashore. Give us drink, Larry. Ay vas little drunk,
not
<===>
[Slowly.] Ay tank, after your mo'der die, ven Ay vas avay on
voyage, it's better for you you don't never see me! [He sinks down in
the chair opposite her dejectedly--then turns to her--sadly.] Ay don't
know, Anna, vhy Ay never come home Sveden in ole year. Ay vant come
home end of every voyage. Ay vant see your mo'der, your two bro'der
before dey vas drowned, you ven you vas born--but--Ay--don't go. Ay
sign on oder ships--go South America, go Australia, go China, go every
port all over world many times--but Ay never go aboard ship sail for
Sveden. Ven Ay gat money for pay passage home as passenger den--[He
bows his head guiltily.] Ay forgat and Ay spend all money. Ven Ay tank
again, it's too late. [He sighs.] Ay don't know vhy but dat's vay with
most sailor fallar, Anna. Dat ole davil sea make dem crazy fools with
her dirty tricks. It's so.

I don't care. Don't speak to me again.
<===>
I don't know whether I want to laugh or to cry.

Believe me, you are mistaken about this, Miss Valborg. You
don't see things as plainly as I do.
<===>
JUNO. I don't think we'll talk about it any more. Danger is all
very well when you do escape; but sometimes one doesn't. I tell you
frankly I don't feel as safe as you do--if you really do.

But surely you can do as you please without injuring anyone,
Mrs. Juno. That is the whole secret of your extraordinary charm for me.
<===>
Yes, I love you!  You are more to me than anything in
the whole world.  What does your husband give you?  Nothing.  Whatever is
in him he gives to this wretched woman, whom he has thrust into your
society, into your home, to shame you before every one.  I offer you my
lifeâ€”
