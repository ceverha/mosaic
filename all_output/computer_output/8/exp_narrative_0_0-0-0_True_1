A:
	Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.

B:
	That she has. I've inquired. Well, even so. I don't care nothin' about
that. Was she to wait for me, eh? She didn't know nothin' about me when
that happened. She's hot-blooded;

A:
	Well, if you love her you've got to let me shoot the dirty dog
that drags her down!

B:
	How the devil do I know what's to become of you? What does it
matter what becomes of you?

A:
	I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.

B:
	Then have respect for me--and go!

A:
	[Looks earnestly at her.] Hilda--you are like a wild bird of the woods.

B:
	(raising his lantern)
  Who is there? I cannot see what you are like,
  Come to the light.

A:
	You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.

B:
	Sarah! That is a lie! Say what you want, but don't insult me
with a lie!

A:
	Father! Father! Help me; save me.

B:
	My poor unfortunate son!
Now are you saved from the evil one!
There comes Lord Arne with Ingeborg, your wife!

A:
	With you dead, what keeps me alive?

B:
	I'll say that as often as you want me to. It's true.

A:
	[With an indulgent smile.] So you'd like to be known as a
reformed character, eh?

B:
	[Looking at him and shaking her head.] I don't think I quite
understand you.
