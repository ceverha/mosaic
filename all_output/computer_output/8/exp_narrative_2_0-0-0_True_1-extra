Similarity pairs

How are you doing today? I haven't seen you in a while.
<===>
Yes; I almost think I should. But now, for
this summer, I would rather you were like yourself alone, and exactly as
you are.

Do you like me best as I am?
<===>
Because I am I and you are you.

No wonder your drawing's queer. A man who can't reach another
man--(TOM _here reaches them by pointing the revolver in the air and
firing it_. DICK _digs his hand into the dirt_.
<===>
Maybe he's stolen off to Belmullet with
the boots of Michael James, and you'd have a right so to follow after
him, Sara Tansey, and you the one yoked the ass cart and drove ten
miles to set your eyes on the man bit the yellow lady's nostril on the
northern shore. [She looks out.]

Really? Now that's hard to believe. 
<===>
Indeed? Do you believe it?

But your twenty-one years and, ah, good God!... You still carry about
with you most merrily the eggshells on your back--as the infantry
carries the knapsack. You hadn't the slightest idea of what are
commonly called "women"--of
<===>
Yes--at least that's what one tells oneself--perhaps one feels it,
too.--It depends--more in the evening than the morning--more in March
than October.--But the dread, the horror of it, is always there.--The
weight of such love is like the weight of one's own coffin-lid.--And
you soon discovered that, Pierre.--Then you began softly, gently, to
bind me to you with glances and caresses that were like chains of
roses!--Yes, and that I become maddened by roses as cats by valerian,
that, too, you soon found out.--Then--then you began to speak to me of
the lover's pavilion--all covered with roses--where your ancestors
spent happy, pastoral hours in wooing their loves--the pavilion that
had been waiting so long for a new mistress. You spoke of adorning it
with beautiful hangings--of filling it full of roses. Oh you, you
Pierre, how well you understood!--Do have some black coffee made for
me! If the gardener can't do it, make it yourself! Please, please!

But, I tell you, I have to go back to mamma.
<===>
 Well, I wanted you to come.

It's all about finding the balance.
<===>
The end of everything, all the same? How--?

Now you know, John.
<===>
You think yourself very wise, Johnny Bacach. Can you tell me, now, who
that man is?

Some decent lad, I suppose, with a good way of living and a mind to
send up his name upon the roads.
<===>
And the end of the story is that the firm of Muhlingk, along
with its clever representative, is a few thousands richer because of
us. It's a shame! you ought to have profited by it yourself. Well, I'll
open your employer's eyes to the kind of a man you've been! If he
doesn't at least make you a partner, I shall declare such a corner in
coffee, in my righteous wrath, that the noble German oak-leaf[6] shall
be valued as never before. But, seriously, why do you insist on this
caprice of remaining with the Muhlingks? I offer you a tremendous
salary and a pair of trousers every Christmas. (Robert _shakes his
head_) It isn't only gratitude that makes a man cling to such an insane
idea! Of course if the inventory of the firm included a fair German
maiden--(_Aside_) Aha! (_To_ Robert) Speaking of maidens, just listen
to what happened to me last night. After we had left each other I
wandered aimlessly along the street. A friendly poster invited into a
masked ball. A hundred Indian dancers were to present their exciting
dance according to the advertisement--well, that is my specialty--I
went in. Everything seemed arranged to lead a young monk to forget his
oath. And then suddenly there came before me a young girl, tender and
fresh as a half-ripe peach. She seemed to be without a partner. I
presented myself. Not at all bashful, she begged for a little plaything
that hung on my watch-chain, in a little baby voice. It was my patron
saint Ganesa, god of success, who rides on a little rat. And I smelled
a rat myself. What do you suppose I found beneath her childish
innocence? Naif depravity!

That is surprising - I never thought about it like that before.
<===>
That was just what I did! But that was also just what made the
whole thing happen!

How? Try and tell me a little more calmly and consecutively!
<===>
[Shakes his head.] I feel as if I can talk better to you about
them. [Drawing a deep breath.] And about everything else as well.

What leave you got there, Asta?
<===>
What did you want there?
