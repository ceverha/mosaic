How are you doing today? I haven't seen you in a while.
<===>
Oh yes; and I really intended to answer it. But I haven't
had a moment; and I knew you wouldn't mind. You see, I am so
afraid of boring you by writing about affairs you don't
understand and people you don't know! And yet what else have I to
write about? I begin a letter; and then I tear it up again. The
fact is, fond as we are of one another, Nora, we have so little
in common--I mean of course the things one can put in a letter--that
correspondence is apt to become the hardest of hard work.

Yes: it's hard for me to know anything about you if you
never tell me anything.
<===>
But what else have you to tell me?

I?  Nothing.  When once I have given you the
packet----
<===>
Oh, aunt, I never realised as I did then what you have been to
me! I knew that if I were capable of any great deed, anything really
good or really fine, it was you that had planted the impulse in me. And
then I sought every opportunity to bring this about; I wanted to take
ever so humble a part in it, but without your hearing a word or a sigh
from me. Besides, I had you always before me as an example; because I
knew that you would have done it for me--indeed that you had already
done as much. Your example was like a shining beacon to me, aunt!

Really? Now that's hard to believe. 
<===>
Do you believe that, too?

And I fancy it will be so
cheering for you, too--here in this out-of-the-way place-to know within
yourself that you are, so to say, helping me to create.
<===>
And can't you see, dear, that it's better for us we didn't?
And that it would be better for you now if you would just resolutely
look somewhere else? You must see yourself that you haven't the poise of
people who are held--well, within the circle, if you choose to put it
that way. There's something about being in that main body, having one's
roots in the big common experiences, gives a calm which you have missed.
That's _why_ I want you to take Elizabeth, forget yourself, and--

I do want calm. But mine would have to be a calm I--worked my
way to. A calm all prepared for me--would stink.
<===>
I mean that you ought to go for a stroll in the park and pull
yourself together a little, before the Christensens come. Try to be
calm; come in calmly, and request time to think it over. That is all you
have to do! They will make no difficulty about that, because they must
agree. Nothing has happened yet, and all ways are still open. Do as I
ask!

It's all about finding the balance.
<===>
Most of the successful politicians nowadays have
not gained their position by means of any greatness of their own, but
by the pitiable weakness of others. Another age will form a different
estimate of them--see them in their proper perspective, and find them to
be much smaller men!

But what has that to do with us?
<===>
But what has that to do with me?

Just this much, that if I had been an ordinary stay-at-home man, a
great many things would not have happened.
<===>
Well, if there was more than one, I am sure I know nothing about
it. No, indeed I do not! Besides, the way people gossip and backbite is
the very devil! But, as I was saying, because he dared to look at some
one before he looked at you--before he ever _thought_ of you--is that a
reason for throwing him over for good and all? How many would ever get
married under those circumstances, I should like to know? Everybody
confirms the opinion that he is an honourable, fine young fellow, to
whom the proudest girl might confidently entrust herself--you said so
yourself, only a day or two ago! Do not deny it! And now he is suddenly
to be thrown over, because you are not the first girl he has ever met!
Pride should have some limits, remember! I have never heard of anything
more preposterous, if you ask me.

That is surprising - I never thought about it like that before.
<===>
What is it? What have I to--

You have to go and be a pillar of
society, brother-in-law.
<===>
Well, well, go your way, Senor Don Juan. I prefer to be my
own master and not the tool of any blundering universal force. I know
that beauty is good to look at; that music is good to hear; that love is
good to feel; and that they are all good to think about and talk about.
I know that to be well exercised in these sensations, emotions, and
studies is to be a refined and cultivated being. Whatever they may say
of me in churches on earth, I know that it is universally admitted in
good society that the prince of Darkness is a gentleman; and that is
enough for me. As to your Life Force, which you think irresistible, it
is the most resistible thing in the world for a person of any character.
But if you are naturally vulgar and credulous, as all reformers are, it
will thrust you first into religion, where you will sprinkle water on
babies to save their souls from me; then it will drive you from religion
into science, where you will snatch the babies from the water
sprinkling and inoculate them with disease to save them from catching it
accidentally; then you will take to politics, where you will become the
catspaw of corrupt functionaries and the henchman of ambitious humbugs;
and the end will be despair and decrepitude, broken nerve and
shattered hopes, vain regrets for that worst and silliest of wastes
and sacrifices, the waste and sacrifice of the power of enjoyment: in
a word, the punishment of the fool who pursues the better before he has
secured the good.

But at least I shall not be bored. The service of the Life
Force has that advantage, at all events. So fare you well, Senor Satan.

Fellow citizens--your
spokesman said just now that tonight we are standing on the threshold
of a new era. I hope that will prove to be the case. But before that
can come to pass, we must lay fast hold of truth--truth which, till
tonight, has been altogether and in all circumstances a stranger to
this community of ours. (Astonishment among the audience.) To that end,
I must begin by deprecating the praises with which you, Mr. Rorlund,
according to custom on such occasions, have overwhelmed me. I do not
deserve them; because, until today, my actions have by no means been
disinterested. Even though I may not always have aimed at pecuniary
profit, I at all events recognise now that a craving for power,
influence and position has been the moving spirit of most of my actions.
