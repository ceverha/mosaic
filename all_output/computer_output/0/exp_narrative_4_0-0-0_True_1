A:
	Let me get this straight. You did what?

B:
	You can depend on me.

A:
	You know also, Mr. Johnson, I hope, that you can depend on
ME.

B:
	[politely] Quite so.

A:
	I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.

B:
	But you are not ready to go, Sannaes! You have not finished
your work here yet! There is what I just spoke of--and something else
that dates farther back than that.

A:
	[Notices LADY KIRSTEN and her retinue.]  Lady Kirsten!
you here?  Well, I am glad of that.

B:
	And what you blab about I believe still less.  You are
provoked with Ingeborg because at times she makes fun of you, and
therefore you begrudge her this attractive marriage; yes,

A:
	Get out! GET OUT!

B:
	Rest easy, little one--you do.

A:
	(_Shakes his head_) If Herr Muhlingk, Junior, sends word, or
comes himself, call me. (_He goes off_)

B:
	Come along! (LEONARDA gets up, dries her
eyes, and meets them with a smile.) Aunt, here he is!

A:
	I don't care. Don't speak to me again.

B:
	Nothing stays at home. Not even the corn stays at home. If only the
wind wouldn't blow! Why can't I have my field to myself? Why can't I
keep what's mine? All these years I've worked to make it better.

A:
	I found--what I find now I know. The edge of life--to hold
life behind me--

B:
	How well he plays at faith! He is like the monk when he had nothing
more to say.
