A:
	We are lost in this cave. How much more battery power do we have left?

B:
	Why have you only begun to realise that now?

A:
	Because, in twenty-four hours, I shall be a dead man.

B:
	[Sharply, but in a whisper.] Oswald! take care! are you mad? Let
me go!

A:
	How much food do we have left? I'm beginning to worry.

B:
	Father, forgive me for all that
I have neglected to do! You shall see how I will try and make up for it!
How hard I shall work!

A:
	I have told you, Joyzelle, his life is in my hands and cannot escape
without my consent. I warned you of it. The poison is doing its work
and I can see it.

B:
	I am here, Joyzelle....

A:
	Look! Is that a shaft of light I see?

B:
	{Slowly.} I'm thinking many would be afeard, but I never knew what
way I'd be afeard of beggar or bishop or any man of you at all. {She
looks towards the window and lowers her voice.}

A:
	[Sadly] You have found your way, you know where you are
going, but I am still groping in a chaos of phantoms and dreams, not
knowing whom and what end I am serving by it all.

B:
	Nonsense. I AM a doctor. But mind you, dont call Walpole one.

A:
	Hooray! We've escaped!

B:
	          Praises be for ever!

A:
	Silence! for you have taken Forgaelâ€™s pay.

B:
	Sit down, won't you?
