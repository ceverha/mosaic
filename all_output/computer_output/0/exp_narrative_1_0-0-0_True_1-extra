We are lost in this cave. How much more battery power do we have left?
<===>
And you have no right to; no right to despise me! Lona, you
can have no idea how utterly alone I stand in this cramped and stunted
community--where I have had, year after year, to stifle my ambition for
a fuller life. My work may seem many-sided, but what have I really
accomplished? Odds and ends--scraps. They would not stand anything else
here. If I were to go a step in advance of the opinions and views that
are current at the moment, I should lose all my influence. Do you know
what we are--we who are looked upon as pillars of society? We are
nothing more, nor less, than the tools of society.

Why have you only begun to realise that now?
<===>
That I can well believe, father, if only you have the time necessary to
do it.

Because, in twenty-four hours, I shall be a dead man.
<===>
[Under her breath, but firmly.] No. But then this long,
hateful comedy will be ended. From the day after to-morrow, I shall act
in every way as though he who is dead had never lived in this house.
There shall be no one here but my boy and his mother.

How much food do we have left? I'm beginning to worry.
<===>
Don't you understand, dear? I believe I could become of some
use in the office. And in that way, you know, we might begin afresh--and
try, with God's help, to pay your creditors.

Father, forgive me for all that
I have neglected to do! You shall see how I will try and make up for it!
How hard I shall work!
<===>
If I wish you to save him!... But do you not see that, if you were
to hesitate, do you not know that, if for his sake, I had to.... No,
no, I meant to say ... my distress bewilders me.... He has ceased to
breathe, I no longer hear his heart.... You seem to me so slow!...
Do you think that there is no danger, no need for haste?... I will
speak no more; I am making you lose minutes which perhaps were
passing to save him.... If you will not help him yourself--and I can
understand that, for you do not love him--tell me only what I must do
to assist him; and I shall know how to do it.... But I can see, I am
sure that he cannot wait and that we must make haste....

I have told you, Joyzelle, his life is in my hands and cannot escape
without my consent. I warned you of it. The poison is doing its work
and I can see it.
<===>
Lancéor! Lancéor!... He cannot hear me.... His eyes are wide open....
Lancéor, I am here, I am bending over your eyes.... Look at me, look
at me!... No, he does not see me!... Lancéor, for pity's sake!...
If your voice is too weak, give a sign of life!... I take you in my
arms, my arms that love you!... Come, come, come to yourself, in
our great love!... See, see, it is my hands that are lifting your
head.... Do you recognize my hands, as they stroke your hair?... You
so often told me, when we were happy, that the least caress of these
dear hands would recall your soul, even from the greatest happiness
of paradise, from the greatest darkness in the depths of.... No, no,
it is not there!... But his head is drooping, his arm falls back
lifeless and his fingers seem to me colder than this marble....
(_Mechanically feeling one of the columns of the bed._) No, it is
not that.... But I must know.... And his eyes are no longer....
(_Raising his head._) Is it his or mine that are so dim?... No, it
is impossible!... No, no, I will not have it! Ah, I will open your
lips!... (_She places her lips on LANCÉOR'S._) Lancéor! Lancéor! All
the ardour of my life shall enter your heart!... Do not fear, do not
fear! It is the saving flame and life that restores life!... Breathe
it all in the last efforts of my breath which loves you!... I would
gladly suffocate in exchanging my life for yours!... I give you my
strength, my hours, my years!... Here they are, here they are!...
You have but to make a movement, to open your lips!... It must be
so!... It must be possible thus to give new life to those whom we
love better than ourselves!... When we give them all, they cannot but
take it!... (_Raising her head to look at LANCÉOR._) He is falling
back! He is going from me!... (_Infatuated, she takes him in her arms
again._) Help!... No, this is too much!... Help! Hasten! Hasten!...
Ah no, I know better, no, no, it is not that.... Death does not
come like this when love threatens it!... No, no, I fear nothing,
no, no, I will not have it!... But I am crying for help! I cannot
remain alone, I cannot fight alone against all the strength of death
approaching!... If no one comes, it will end by conquering!... Help,
I say!... You must come to my aid!... Life must help me, or it is no
longer possible and we shall succumb!...

Look! Is that a shaft of light I see?
<===>
{Sitting down.} I knew rightly. {He lights his pipe so that there
is a sharp light beneath his haggard face.} And I was thinking, and I
coming in through the door, that it's many a lone woman would be afeard
of the like of me in the dark night, in a place wouldn't be so lonesome
as this place, where there aren't two living souls would see the little
light you have shining from the glass.

{Slowly.} I'm thinking many would be afeard, but I never knew what
way I'd be afeard of beggar or bishop or any man of you at all. {She
looks towards the window and lowers her voice.}
<===>
Why do you say that you have kissed the ground I walked on? You
should kill me rather. [She bends over the table] I am so tired. If I
could only rest--rest. [She raises her head] I am a sea-gull--no--no,
I am an actress. [She hears ARKADINA and TRIGORIN laughing in the
distance, runs to the door on the left and looks through the keyhole] He
is there too. [She goes back to TREPLIEFF] Ah, well--no matter. He
does not believe in the theatre; he used to laugh at my dreams, so that
little by little I became down-hearted and ceased to believe in it too.
Then came all the cares of love, the continual anxiety about my little
one, so that I soon grew trivial and spiritless, and played my parts
without meaning. I never knew what to do with my hands, and I could not
walk properly or control my voice. You cannot imagine the state of mind
of one who knows as he goes through a play how terribly badly he is
acting. I am a sea-gull--no--no, that is not what I meant to say. Do you
remember how you shot a seagull once? A man chanced to pass that way and
destroyed it out of idleness. That is an idea for a short story, but it
is not what I meant to say. [She passes her hand across her forehead]
What was I saying? Oh, yes, the stage. I have changed now. Now I am a
real actress. I act with joy, with exaltation, I am intoxicated by it,
and feel that I am superb. I have been walking and walking, and thinking
and thinking, ever since I have been here, and I feel the strength of
my spirit growing in me every day. I know now, I understand at last,
Constantine, that for us, whether we write or act, it is not the honour
and glory of which I have dreamt that is important, it is the strength
to endure. One must know how to bear one’s cross, and one must have
faith. I believe, and so do not suffer so much, and when I think of my
calling I do not fear life.

[Sadly] You have found your way, you know where you are
going, but I am still groping in a chaos of phantoms and dreams, not
knowing whom and what end I am serving by it all.
<===>
Oh, it is so cruel to keep telling me that. It seems all
right; and it puts me in the wrong. But I am not in the wrong. I have
faith in you; and I have no faith in the others. We have seen so many
doctors: I have come to know at last when they are only talking and can
do nothing. It is different with you. I feel that you know. You must
listen to me, doctor. [With sudden misgiving] Am I offending you by
calling you doctor instead of remembering your title?

Hooray! We've escaped!
<===>
I would I had thy Cashel by the collar:
    He hath escaped me.

          Praises be for ever!
<===>
I’ve thought of that. We must have Aibric with us,
  For he can judge the stars as well as Forgael.

Silence! for you have taken Forgael’s pay.
<===>
hope you will excuse my coming so late, but I have already
been called upon to pay some professional visits.
