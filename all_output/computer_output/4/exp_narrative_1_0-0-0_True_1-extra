We are lost in this cave. How much more battery power do we have left?
<===>
It’s well that we should speak our minds out plainly,
  For when we die we shall be spoken of
  In many countries. We in our young days
  Have seen the heavens like a burning cloud
  Brooding upon the world, and being more
  Than men can be now that cloud’s lifted up,
  We should be the more truthful. Conchubar,
  I do not like your children—they have no pith,
  No marrow in their bones, and will lie soft
  Where you and I lie hard.

You rail at them
  Because you have no children of your own.

[_consulting his notes_] When you were arrested you were both
completely destitute. What remained of your furniture had been sold,
and you were entering upon a state of complete vagabondage. No doubt
you also will accuse society. You are an unruly person. You frequent
Socialist clubs; and when you don’t affect a cynical carelessness in
your language, as you are doing now, you like to repeat the empty
phrases you have picked up from the propagandist pamphlets which are
poisoning the minds of the working classes. But we know all about you;
and if you are a victim, you are the victim of your vices. You drink.

have taken to it lately. That’s true.

But that's rather general, and there isn't much in it to give
us self-confidence. But when you think we have hands because ages
back--before life had taken form as man, there was an impulse to do what
had never been done--when you think that we have hands today because
from the first of life there have been adventurers--those of best brain
and courage who wanted to be more than life had been, and that from
aspiration has come doing, and doing has shaped the thing with which to
do--it gives our hand a history which should make us want to use it
well.

How much food do we have left? I'm beginning to worry.
<===>
How do you have time to stop in here?

Well, I had to unsaddle, and anyhow have ridden four and a half miles.
It was only the question whether I should feed the horse at Braun's at
the entrance where one gets merely water or----
<===>
Yes, summer! [Takes out the check book.] You see the money is
already in the bank, and when school is over we will start for the
North, for our home land among the lakes. The cottage stands there just
as it did when we were children, and the linden trees. Oh, that it were
summer already and I could go swimming in the lake! I feel as if this
family dishonor has besmirched me so that I long to bathe, body and
soul, in the clear lake waters.

Have you heard anything from Eleonora?
<===>
You heard nothing from me that I did not tell you before.

Look! Is that a shaft of light I see?
<===>
Oh, certainly. Ive quite done with you. [Rising and holding up
the sketch block] There! While youve been talking, Ive been doing. What
is there left of your moralizing? Only a little carbonic acid gas which
makes the room unhealthy. What is there left of my work? That. Look at
it [Ridgeon rises to look at it].

Of course. What else?
<===>
Of course it does!

From our dear Herr Kurt, I suppose?
<===>
What can I do, my dear?

Hooray! We've escaped!
<===>
If I could only escape seeing him!

Yes, you must stay in the house.
<===>
The third night after----?  Ay, right enough.--Would
you seek the lady of the house at once?  I think she is not yet
gone to rest.  But might you not sit down and rest awhile, dear
young Sir?  See, here is yet a flagon of wine remaining, and
doubtless you will find some food.  Come, fall to; you will do
wisely to refresh your strength.

You are right, Sir; 'twere not amiss.
    (Sits down by the table and eats and drinks.)
Both roast meat and sweet cakes!  Why, you live like lords here!
When
<===>
What is eaten is gone. I want pennies for my bag. I must buy bacon
in the shops, and nuts in the market, and strong drink for the time
when the sun is weak. And I want snares to catch the rabbits and the
squirrels and the hares, and a pot to cook them in.
