Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.
<===>
Well, I thought it should be the young wife of a sailor, who
lies sleeping in strange unrest, and she is dreaming. I fancy I shall do
it so that you will see she is dreaming.

Is there anything else?
<===>
Is there anything--?

Yes.
<===>
Oh, yes I am!

I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.
<===>
I love you! It is you I have loved in her--since the very first
day. I love you!

Then have respect for me--and go!
<===>
Then we shall be free.  We shall have no more foreign
masters, and can choose ourselves a king, as the Swedes have done
before us.

A king for ourselves.  Are you
thinking of the Sture stock?
<===>
Yes, I think I may pride myself on that. And this matter of
the water supply is of the greatest importance to us small tradesmen.
The Baths promise to be a regular gold-mine for the town. We shall all
make our living out of them, especially those of us who are
householders. That is why we will back up the project as strongly as
possible. And as I am at present Chairman of the Householders'
Association.

You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.
<===>
Yes, do, dear! I couldn't, just now; and I am sure your
father couldn't either. You speak to him! (Gets up.) Come, Signe, you
and I must have a talk; you must open your heart to me now.--Ah, when
have we ever had a real talk together? (SIGNE goes to her.) Where is
your father?

He went upstairs.
<===>
He was silent--and went back.

Went back! But he'll return!----
<===>
What! Back again?

With you dead, what keeps me alive?
<===>
What’s the good of my telling you? It’s all over. There’s
nothing left. He didn’t love me: he never loved me. He’s gone. He’s
going to marry another woman.

He’s _gone_?
<===>
She has gone away?

She loves the man you--? Good God, look at Hagbart!
<===>
I no longer desire happiness: life is nobler than that.
Parson James: I give you my happiness with both hands: I love you
because you have filled the heart of the woman I loved. Good-bye. (He
goes towards the door.)
