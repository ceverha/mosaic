A:
	Let me get this straight. You did what?

B:
	Come, faeries, take me out of this dull house!
    Let me have all the freedom I have lost;
    Work when I will and idle when I will!
    Faeries, come, take me out of this dull world,
    For I would ride with you upon the wind,
    Run on the top of the dishevelled tide,
    And dance upon the mountains like a flame!

A:
	Yes, and Gertrud especially.

B:
	Doctor: you must save my husband. You must. When I explain
to you, you will see that you must. It is not an ordinary case, not like
any other case. He is not like anybody else in the world: oh, believe
me, he is not. I can prove it to you: [fingering her portfolio] I have
brought some things to shew you. And you can save him: the papers say
you can.

A:
	I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.

B:
	In a fortnight.

A:
	How so?

B:
	Don Juan: shall I be frank with you?

A:
	Get out! GET OUT!

B:
	It is getting damp. Go back and put on your goloshes.

A:
	Well, we won't let him disturb us. (They begin walking up and
down again in front of the house.)

B:
	[_Sharply._] What have the cops got to do with us? We're
breaking no laws.

A:
	I don't care. Don't speak to me again.

B:
	I have just told you; he went down to the Orphanage.

A:
	Yes, unquestionably it is due to that poisonous morass
up at Molledal.

B:
	know what I’m talking about. Sometimes when I take my work
to the shop they refuse it with an insolent contempt they would never
dare to show to a man. It’s true. For I am doubly unprotected since I
am a woman and I need work.
