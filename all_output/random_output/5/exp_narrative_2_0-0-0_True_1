A:
	How are you doing today? I haven't seen you in a while.

B:
	[Giving his hand]. There--[The telephone rings; Elis goes to
it.] Hello!--No answer. Hello!--No answer but my own voice.--Who is
it?--That's strange. I only hear the echo of my own words.

A:
	I cannot, I tell you; I am not well. Or, at all events,
wait--let me pull myself together. (RORLUND comes in from the right.)

B:
	must say, I don’t see—

A:
	Really? Now that's hard to believe. 

B:
	We shall soon part, perhaps never to meet again. I should like you
to accept this little medallion as a remembrance of me. I have had your
initials engraved on it, and on this side is the name of one of your
books: “Days and Nights.”

A:
	Rauchhaupt--well, o' course. Why not?

B:

A:
	I often try it in the House !

B:
	Yes.  Have you found out at what time Lord Windermere
came in last night?

A:
	That is surprising - I never thought about it like that before.

B:
	[after a moment of stupefaction at the old man's readiness in
repartee] Look here: what do you mean by gittin into my car and lettin
me bring you here if you're not the person I took that note to?

A:
	Why I exactly? Now, look here, that's ...

B:
	That's right! That's the way! Don't you care who it is, neither. I think
it was Leontine.
