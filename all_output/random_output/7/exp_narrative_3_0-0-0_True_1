A:
	I can't believe you threw that ball over the fence. Now you're going to have to go into that dark, scary, spooky forest all by yourself!

B:
	Here is a key that 
opens the door on the river.

A:
	You remember what Crofts said.

B:
	Has she the "aptitude" for being a bankrupt's daughter now?

A:
	Hurry up! You're making me worried. [hears scream] What was that? Hold on!

B:
	It's about three years ago, now, or a little longer. It was just
when I expected the child.

A:
	[_Who has tried to take the pistol_.] Let it go, Leopold; what do you
want with it? See, he's holding the pistol and won't let it go.

B:
	They're hanging no one this day, Mary
Doul, and yet, with the help of God, you'll see a power hanged before
you die.

A:
	It hurts so much, make it stop!

B:
	But a person ought to know that a few days ahead o' time.

A:
	Hadidja, I know thee. Speak!

B:
	[_greatly excited, in a low voice_] Donâ€™t move. You are
entrancing. [_He kisses her upon the arm; she pulls it away sharply_].

A:
	Be quiet. 

B:
	You drunken rascal, I'll see you in the dock for this.

A:
	Emoi of Sanjo, Kozari of Mibu.

B:
	Nay, nay,
There was reason enough for such a fear.
But thanks be to Heaven that fear is gone;
And now no longer I stand alone;
My spirit now is as light and free
As a child's at play 'neath the greenwood tree.
     [With a sudden start of fear.
