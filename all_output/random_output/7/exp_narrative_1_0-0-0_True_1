A:
	We are lost in this cave. How much more battery power do we have left?

B:
	What am I doin' to you?

A:
	He'll see us out o' the house first; he has plenty against us without
that.

B:
	[_Who has not understood._] What's the matter?

A:
	How much food do we have left? I'm beginning to worry.

B:
	And the father follows the great pendulum of the clock with his
eyes....

A:
	(Significantly.) He knows the way 
to get better! (The more gaily, to Frank.) Keep 
Geordie quiet! (Frank, at the door, looks at her 
fixedly a moment, as if on the point of saying 
something; then checking himself, exit rapidly.) 
I needn't keep you here. We can talk as well â€” any- 
where.

B:
	I am looking forward tremendously to the fancy-dress ball at the
Stenborgs' the day after tomorrow.

A:
	Look! Is that a shaft of light I see?

B:
	May as well be a priest with black sleeves. Now having left the world in
sorrow, I look upon my withered shape. There is no one to pity me now.

A:
	You--wrong? How?

B:
	Well, what is there to say? You see, we know each other so
well.

A:
	Hooray! We've escaped!

B:
	(Astonished.) And what has oc- 
curred to stay it?

A:
	But--how did the lady propose to leave here without being seen?

B:
	Well--will you sell?
