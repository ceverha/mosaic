A:
	Let me get this straight. You did what?

B:
	How did you happen to discover this talent?

A:
	Not from a man who knows that this world is hell. But
since the word offends you, let me soften it, and compare you
simply to an ass. [Larry whitens with anger].

B:
	Leave me in peace! If you had any respect for yourself or me you
could not permit yourself to speak to me in this way. I don't want your
money! I have not asked for it, and never shall.

A:
	I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.

B:
	                  A ribald peer,
    Lord Worthington by name, this morning came
    With honeyed words beseeching me to mount
    His four-in-hand, and to the country hie
    To see some English sport. Being by nature
    Frank as a child, I fell into the snare,
    But took so long to dress that the design
    Failed of its full effect; for not until
    The final round we reached the horrid scene.
    Be silent all; for now I do approach
    My tragedy's catastrophe. Know, then,
    That Heaven did bless me with an only son,
    A boy devoted to his doting mother----

A:
	Yes, I know it.

B:
	[_Nods_.]

A:
	Get out! GET OUT!

B:
	I have believed that we two together would be equal to it.

A:
	The Anti-Suffragets have resolved to take the field.

B:
	[_reflecting_] Let me see. [_A sudden inspiration_] I know.
Isn’t there a dance at the Gontiers’ to-night?

A:
	I don't care. Don't speak to me again.

B:
	To eat. That's what's the matter with you. When a man comes to
your age, he runs down before his midday meal. Eat and drink; and then
have another look at our chances.

A:
	It is useless for us to continue this discussion.

B:
	[Regarding him fixedly.] But you like bear-hunting best?
