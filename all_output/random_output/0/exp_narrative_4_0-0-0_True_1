A:
	Let me get this straight. You did what?

B:
	Not a line?

A:
	Certainly I have.

B:
	Now I'm goin' to blaspheme a bit. I'm not opposed to the building of
churches at all.

A:
	I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.

B:
	No, thank you, ma'am. Pastor Manders will look after me, I know.
And if the worst comes to the worst, I know of one house where I've
every right to a place.

A:
	Don't " keep " them â€” bring them to me ! (Then checking her 
as she is going.) But there's Something you can keep for me.

B:
	[_to Pierre Poiret_] You deserve the greatest credit, M. Pierre
Poiret.

A:
	Get out! GET OUT!

B:
	Horribly. (He moves the chair slowly, with great misgiving,
to the end of the couch.)

A:
	Might that be you?

B:
	Now the third charge against you: last night you
set fire to my house and burned it clear to the ground.  Perhaps
human life has been lost,--that we not know as yet,--but whether
or no, it will neither harm nor help your cause; for your
intention to burn all of us is as clear as day.  Do you deny my
charge that you set fire to my home last night?

A:
	I don't care. Don't speak to me again.

B:
	That they may be entirely separate.  It would be better
for us both.

A:
	What are you right about?

B:
	Exactly.
