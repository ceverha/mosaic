A:
	We are lost in this cave. How much more battery power do we have left?

B:
	A great battle at Slivnitza! A victory! And it was
won by Sergius.

A:
	Can't you tell him? No, that wouldn't do.

B:
	It was rather the cold that killed him.

A:
	How much food do we have left? I'm beginning to worry.

B:
	Here we have the topmost pinnacle of authority! (Takes
the Mayor's official hat carefully between his finger-tips and holds it
up in the air.)

A:
	Yes, I knew if I sneezed you would bring the pepper.

B:
	You?  What will you do?

A:
	Look! Is that a shaft of light I see?

B:
	_defiantly, raising his voice._—Let me make haste? I’ll be making haste
maybe to hit you a great clout; for I’m thinking on the day I got you
above at Rathvanna, and the way you began crying out and saying, “I’ll
go back to my ma,” and I’m thinking on the way I came behind you that
time, and hit you a great clout in the lug, and how quiet and easy it
was you came along with me from that hour to this present day.

A:
	Yes. At least--

B:
	Mad as a March hare. He did frighten me, I can tell you
just before you came in that time. Haven't you noticed the queer things
he says?

A:
	Hooray! We've escaped!

B:
	[_In monosyllables_.] Thank you!

A:
	Skoal! [Downing her port at a gulp like a drink of whiskey--her
lips trembling.] Skoal? Guess I know that word, all right, all right!

B:
	 I can imagine all sorts of men I could fall in love with;
but I never seem to meet them.  The real ones are too small, like
Bunny, or too silly, like Jerry.  Of course one can get into a state
about any man:  fall in love with him if you like to call it that.
But who would risk marrying a man for love?  _I_ shouldnt.  I remember
three girls at school who agreed that the one man you should never
marry was the man you were in love with, because it would make a
perfect slave of you.  Theres a sort of instinct against it, I think,
thats just as strong as the other instinct.  One of them, to my
certain knowledge, refused a man she was in love with, and married
another who was in love with her; and it turned out very well.
