A:
	I can't believe you threw that ball over the fence. Now you're going to have to go into that dark, scary, spooky forest all by yourself!

B:
	[Decidedly, turning to IRENE.] Shall we meet up there then?

A:
	What do you mean?

B:
	I thought I heard the noise I used to hear when my friends came to
visit me.

A:
	Hurry up! You're making me worried. [hears scream] What was that? Hold on!

B:
	and Madame Mairaut, monsieur. They wish to speak to you.

A:
	Prithee, Rabbi.

B:
	Yes, yes.

A:
	It hurts so much, make it stop!

B:
	[Lively again, looks at him.] Perhaps you have even forgotten what day
it was?

A:
	Then I'll sit here until I get the money. [_He sits down._] You
will pay day after to-morrow? Excellent! Here I stay until day after
to-morrow. [_Jumps up._] I ask you, do I have to pay that interest
to-morrow or not? Or do you think I'm joking?

B:
	Yes, you are; you must be. And in what state of mind has he
returned to you? Bethink yourself well, Mrs. Alving. You sinned greatly
against your husband;--that you recognise by raising yonder memorial to
him. Recognise now, also, how you have sinned against your son--there
may yet be time to lead him back from the paths of error. Turn back
yourself, and save what may yet be saved in him. For [With uplifted
forefinger] verily, Mrs. Alving, you are a guilt-laden mother! This I
have thought it my duty to say to you.

A:
	Be quiet. 

B:
	I swear it, Salom√©.

A:
	[_Looking up._] The crows are my darlings! I like
their harsh merriment better than those sad cries of the wind and the
rushes. Look at them, they are tossing about like witches, tossing about
on the wind, drunk with the wind.

B:
	Well, then the passengers jump out and move about a little, Mrs. Hedda.
