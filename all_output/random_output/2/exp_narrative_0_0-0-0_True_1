A:
	Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.

B:
	[sighing] So do you.

A:
	Not a ray of hope. Everything perfect, wonderful, real.
It only needs a cathedral to be a heavenly city instead of a
hellish one.

B:
	Do you mean that the factories are like Marcus's tigers? That
they don't exist?

A:
	I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.

B:
	Meixner.

A:
	Well,--is your wife tolerably satisfied--

B:
	What?

A:
	You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.

B:
	[Running to her father] Father! He has rushed over here like a
madman, and is torturing me! He insists that I should refuse to marry
him; he says he doesn't want to drag me down with him. Tell him that I
won't accept his generosity. I know what I am doing!

A:
	[_half-returning his bow_] Good day, M. Courthezon.

B:
	(_with interest_) Are you suffering?

A:
	With you dead, what keeps me alive?

B:
	[Following.] Yes, but have you noticed what splendid condition she is
in? How she has filled out on the journey?

A:
	[After a pause.] Yes, there's a lot in all this we don't know
about.

B:
	[Nods.] I never miss, madam.
