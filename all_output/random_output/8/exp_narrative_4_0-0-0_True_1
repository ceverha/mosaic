A:
	Let me get this straight. You did what?

B:
	But I am married already. I have two daughters.

A:
	Horrible! I won't do it! (Lifts ANNA in his arms as if she were a
child.)

B:
	Oh! Lord Goring is president.

A:
	I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.

B:
	Who?

A:
	[Recovering himself]. You were mistaken.

B:
	Yes, that is life. And I--?

A:
	Get out! GET OUT!

B:
	A world, my child, which one never outgrows, which one never should
outgrow--you have always held to that?

A:
	[Surprised, looking at her.]  Do _I_ know it?  Yes, of course.

B:
	Is the gentleman going to join us?

A:
	I don't care. Don't speak to me again.

B:
	Then we must consult Uncle Mar√©chal, since he is the
principal person concerned.

A:
	Then can't you understand that, a foundling though I am, a desire might
come over me to see my own mother, though she be but a common beggar
and an outcast? That I might want to lay my head on her shoulder and be
petted and fondled, and cry myself to sleep on mine--on my own mother's
breast?

B:
	asked him if the matter was too serious for our own
doctor to deal with.
