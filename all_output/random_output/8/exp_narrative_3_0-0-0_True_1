A:
	I can't believe you threw that ball over the fence. Now you're going to have to go into that dark, scary, spooky forest all by yourself!

B:
	What are the blear-eyed scum crying?

A:
	You must listen to me--

B:
	 Well, they tell me that the girls there have adventures
sometimes.  _[She goes out through the inner door]_

A:
	Hurry up! You're making me worried. [hears scream] What was that? Hold on!

B:
	Gunnar's?

A:
	(_Who has gone over to_ Lenore, _aside_) You don't need to be so
disagreeable.

B:
	I'll take it in the boat. (Confident, engaging.) You See if I 
don't !

A:
	It hurts so much, make it stop!

B:
	Oh, the picture of Paul ?

A:
	How often?

B:
	Yes. For we two--she and I--we are two real comrades. We have absolute
faith in each other; so we can sit and talk with perfect frankness--

A:
	Be quiet. 

B:
	Thou speak'st of Cashel Byron?

A:
	Certainly!  A bridal crown and silver rings and
golden bracelet.  You will find plenty of them in the coffers and
chests.

B:
	Yes; he went down to the Orphanage.
