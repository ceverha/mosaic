A:
	We are lost in this cave. How much more battery power do we have left?

B:
	Will you be still!

A:
	And has given lectures in public--

B:
	I really went as governess. But his wife--his late wife--was an
invalid,--and rarely left her room. So I had to look after the
housekeeping as well.

A:
	How much food do we have left? I'm beginning to worry.

B:
	There are no dark curls on my neck now--the curls you once loved
to twist round your fingers.

A:
	What evil is there here,
    That is not everywhere from this to the sea?

B:
	A bit confused in her upper story, eh?

A:
	Look! Is that a shaft of light I see?

B:
	You mean to break your oath?

A:
	I see, thou hast still a request to make of me. I pray thee, speak!

B:
	You haven't tried at all.

A:
	Hooray! We've escaped!

B:
	don't know why, but it seems as if we had become enemies now.
The strife of position has come between us, and we can never be friends
any more.

A:
	Where are they mooring her this evening, then?

B:
	I foresee that that dog is going to howl all night again. It is
always this way in the country; I have never been able to live as I like
here. I come down for a monthâ€™s holiday, to rest and all, and am
plagued so by their nonsense that I long to escape after the first day.
[Laughing] I have always been glad to get away from this place, but I
have been retired now, and this was the only place I had to come to.
Willy-nilly, one must live somewhere.
