A:
	We are lost in this cave. How much more battery power do we have left?

B:
	That a soul can be so degraded!

A:
	That' a fac'. But don't go makin' a noise. I just plumb forgot all about
it again. I got so many things to think of with my poor head, that
sometimes I just naturally forgets things.

B:
	She has wandered hither from the sea, and can't find her way
out again. And so, you see, she lies there dying in the brackish water.

A:
	How much food do we have left? I'm beginning to worry.

B:
	When I was going away he said to me that if I ever
could give him any private information of real value he would make me a
very rich man.  I was dazed at the prospect he held out to me, and my
ambition and my desire for power were at that time boundless.  Six weeks
later certain private documents passed through my hands.

A:
	Things like that hadn't ought to go unpunished. If anybody hits me, I'll
hit him back. That's what I says.

B:
	Won't you hear me telling you...?

A:
	Look! Is that a shaft of light I see?

B:
	Just so. That's all, really.

A:
	It was directly after I had been home last time, and had got
back to Paris again. I began to feel the most violent pains in my
head--chiefly in the back of my head, they seemed to come. It was as
though a tight iron ring was being screwed round my neck and upwards.

B:
	Then I will not go another step with you. Do you hear?--not a single
step!

A:
	Hooray! We've escaped!

B:
	Be calm, Balsquith. These things must happen; they save
bloodshed in the long run, believe me. Ive seen plenty of it; and I
know.

A:
	[Continuing unruffled.] --and agreed that I was to go abroad with you,
and live there for good and all--and enjoy myself.--Do you remember what
you promised me that day?

B:
	Ã–STERMARK. Oh, well, you play then?
