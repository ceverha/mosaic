A:
	How are you doing today? I haven't seen you in a while.

B:
	You are a most accursedly attractive woman. Mind, I am not
making love to you. I do not like being attracted. But you had better
know how I feel if you are going to stay here.

A:
	You are an exceedingly clever lady-killer, Hector. And
terribly handsome. I am quite a good player, myself, at that game. Is it
quite understood that we are only playing?

B:
	Quite. I am deliberately playing the fool, out of sheer
worthlessness.

A:
	In effect, you got your claws deeper into me than I intended.

B:
	Your husband is quite charming, darling. He has actually
condescended to kiss me at last. I shall go into the garden: it's cooler
now [she goes out by the port door].

A:
	Take care, dear child. I don't believe any man can kiss
Addy without falling in love with her. [She goes into the hall].

B:
	Your sister is an extremely enterprising old girl. Where's Miss
Dunn!

A:
	Mangan says she has gone up to her room for a nap. Addy
won't let you talk to Ellie: she has marked you for her own.

B:
	She has the diabolical family fascination. I began making love
to her automatically. What am I to do? I can't fall in love; and I can't
hurt a woman's feelings by telling her so when she falls in love with
me. And as women are always falling in love with my moustache I get
landed in all sorts of tedious and terrifying flirtations in which I'm
not a bit in earnest.

A:
	Oh, neither is Addy. She has never been in love in her
life, though she has always been trying to fall in head over ears. She
is worse than you, because you had one real go at least, with me.

B:
	That was a confounded madness. I can't believe that such an
amazing experience is common. It has left its mark on me. I believe that
is why I have never been able to repeat it.

A:
	I don't know that I want it to come off. It was damned
dangerous. You fascinated me; but I loved you; so it was heaven. This
sister of yours fascinates me; but I hate her; so it is hell. I shall
kill her if she persists.

B:
	HUSHABYE. Nothing will kill Addy; she is as strong as a horse.
[Releasing him]. Now I am going off to fascinate somebody.

A:
	The Foreign Office toff? Randall?

B:
	Goodness gracious, no! Why should I fascinate him?
