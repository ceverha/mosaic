A:
	We are lost in this cave. How much more battery power do we have left?

B:
	What a strange woman you are,
Katherine! Would you prefer to have the boys grow up in a society like
this? You saw for yourself last night that half the population are out
of their minds; and if the other half have not lost their senses, it is
because they are mere brutes, with no sense to lose.

A:
	But, Thomas dear, the imprudent things you said had
something to do with it, you know.

B:
	Well, isn't what I said perfectly true? Don't they turn
every idea topsy-turvy? Don't they make a regular hotchpotch of right
and wrong? Don't they say that the things I know are true, are lies?
The craziest part of it all is the fact of these "liberals," men of
full age, going about in crowds imagining that they are the
broad-minded party! Did you ever hear anything like it, Katherine!

A:
	Yes, yes, it's mad enough of them, certainly;
but--(PETRA comes in from the sitting-room). Back from school already?

B:
	I have been given notice of dismissal.

A:
	Dismissal?

B:
	You too?

A:
	Busk gave me my notice; so I thought it was best to go at
once.

B:
	You were perfectly right, too!

A:
	Busk was a woman like that!

B:
	Busk isn't a bit like that, mother; I saw quite plainly how
it hurt her to do it. But she didn't dare do otherwise, she said; and
so I got my notice.

A:
	She didn't dare do
otherwise, either! It's delicious!

B:
	Well, after the dreadful scenes last night--

A:
	Just listen to this, father!

B:
	Well?
