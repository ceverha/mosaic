A:
	How are you doing today? I haven't seen you in a while.

B:
	Yes; I almost think I should. But now, for
this summer, I would rather you were like yourself alone, and exactly as
you are.

A:
	Do you like me best as I am?

B:
	Yes, I like you immensely as you are.

A:
	Tell me, you who are an artist, do you think I'm right always
to wear bright-coloured summer dresses?

B:
	Yes; I think you're quite right!

A:
	You think bright colours suit me, then?

B:
	They suit you charmingly--to my taste.

A:
	But tell me, as an artist, how do you think I should look in
black?

B:
	In black, Miss Hilde?

A:
	Yes, all in black. Do you think I should look well?

B:
	Black's hardly suitable for the summer. However, you'd
probably look remarkably well in black, especially with your appearance.

A:
	All in black, up to the
throat; black frilling round that, black gloves, and a long black veil
hanging down behind.

B:
	If you were dressed so, Miss Hilde, I should wish I were a
painter, and I'd paint you as a young, beautiful, sorrowing widow!

A:
	Or as a young, sorrowing, betrothed girl!

B:
	Yes, that would be better still. But you can't wish to be
dressed like that?
