	Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.

B:
	Hmmm, yes, she is quite the thing to look at. Her long shiny shinbones....

A:
	(_abruptly moving toward her_) Mrs Peters?

B:
	That's Mr. Peter's wife? How old is she? She seems of the most fertile age. 

A:
	I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.

B:
	She's a married woman, I don't think that line is going to work on her

A:
	I can't, Annie--not yet awhile. You don't see my
meanin'. I got to git the ile.

B:
	Listen John, we have been friends since infacy. I get your meaning, this woman just isnt the one for you. What about that one, over there is the slight yellow shoes?

A:
	You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.

B:
	John? has a fever overcome you? did you eat well today? what is with all this nonsense?

A:
	Tomorrow, then, or never!

B:
	You have got to believe me, she is not the one for you. give it up. You need rest

A:
	With you dead, what keeps me alive?

B:
	John, brother, no one has died? what is this you speak of?

A:
	She had my baby in her claws, that's what! An' she let it starve an' get
sick! I gotta see her! I gotta tell her right out! She's gotta make my
little baby well again! I gotta go to court. The gentleman says as how I
gotta go to court an' give notice.

B:
	You had a child out of wedlock? When? Before her marriage to Mr. Peter?
