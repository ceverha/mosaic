A:
	How are you doing today? I haven't seen you in a while.

B:
	I was on a ship for a few weeks. How are you?

A:
	[Humbly.] Ay'm sorry, Anna.

B:
	[Confused] Sorry for what? And don't call me Anna.

A:
	Really? Now that's hard to believe. 

B:
	Well it's not my name.

A:
	Not exactly that alone, but it might be on that account.

B:
	[Angrily.] On account of my father's honor, my name is not Anna.

A:
	It's all about finding the balance.

B:
	There is no balance to be found here. My name either is Anna or it isn't. And it isn't.

A:
	Give me your advice.

B:
	Don't call me Anna.

A:
	That is surprising - I never thought about it like that before.

B:
	I leave town for a month and you lose your mind.

A:
	(_About to break out--controls himself_) Let's talk about Alma!
Did he offer satisfaction?

B:
	Alma was everything I dreamed of and more. My rashes won't be bothering me anytime soon.
