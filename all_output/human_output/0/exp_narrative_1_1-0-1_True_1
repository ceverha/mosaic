A:
	We are lost in this cave. How much more battery power do we have left?

B:
	Just under half. We better be careful from now on.

A:
	Yes; but I don't think I've a right to; not to forsake father.

B:
	We must! Father would want us to keep going. We can't just stay here and die.

A:
	How much food do we have left? I'm beginning to worry.

B:
	Probably 2 days worth. But I'd be more worried about our water, if I were you.

A:
	Well, women are used to worrying over trifles.

B:
	I'll let you handle all the worrying then. I have no time for such silliness. Oh look, I think I see something!

A:
	Look! Is that a shaft of light I see?

B:
	Finally!!! Some kind of relief. (runs to light and looks up). I can't see much. Quick, boost me up!

A:
	Dudley â€” my feelings dragged me! I don't want any 
one in the world if I can only get you !

B:
	Call me Jared. Dudley is my father

A:
	Hooray! We've escaped!

B:
	Thank god...wait! Is that a bear? Run!

A:
	But if you are not refused?

B:
	Then so be it, Rick.
