A:
	I can't believe you threw that ball over the fence. Now you're going to have to go into that dark, scary, spooky forest all by yourself!

B:
	It's ok, I've watched The Sandlot enough times to realize that any monster is really just a big, friendly dog

A:
	For materials and manufacture alone, half a million Perusalem
dollars, madam. The Inca's design constitutes it a work of art. As such,
it is now worth probably ten million dollars.

B:
	Ten million dollars for a ball?? You idiot, they sell a dozen balls for ten dollars down at the corner store. Who did you even buy it from anyways?

A:
	Hurry up! You're making me worried. [hears scream] What was that? Hold on!

B:
	Ahh!!! Let's get the hell out of here!

A:
	Oh, Father Reilly and
the saints of God, where will I hide myself to-day? Oh, St. Joseph and
St. Patrick and St. Brigid, and St. James, have mercy on me now! [Shawn
turns round, sees door clear, and makes a rush for it.]

B:
	Shawn! Here, take the ball! (throws the ten million dollar ball to Shawn) It's worth more than me anyways. Go on without me

A:
	It hurts so much, make it stop!

B:
	Quick, I'll throw a rock at them and you make a break for it!

A:
	 Youll never give another penny to anything.  This is the
end:  for you and me.

B:
	Who cares about a penny? That fool Shawn has the ten million dollar ball now

A:
	Be quiet. 

B:
	Oh ok. Fuck me then

A:
	Twenty roses nestling close
              Gleam upon thy breast,
            Twenty years of rose-red love
              Upon thy fair cheeks rest.

B:
	That's beautiful. I'll make sure they carve that on your tombstone
