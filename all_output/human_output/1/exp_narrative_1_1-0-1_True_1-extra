[The flashlight shuts off. Darkness.] Does that answer your question? Here, feel around for something to help orient us.
<===>
Oh, what right had you to take him all for yourself! [Pulling
herself together]. There! You couldn't help it: neither of us could help
it. He couldn't help it. No, don't say anything more: I can't bear it.
Let us wake the object. [She begins stroking Mangan's head, reversing
the movement with which she put him to sleep]. Wake up, do you hear? You
are to wake up at once. Wake up, wake up, wake--
Oh, you're BEGINNING to worry? [B feels around their knapsack.] A couple granola bars, some trail mix, and... [B produces a purring object.] We've got Mr. Sniffles.

We will. (They all mix themselves some
toddy.) And let us have the cigars. Ejlif, you know where the box is.
And you, Morten, can fetch my pipe. (The two boys go into the room on
the right.) I have a suspicion that Ejlif pockets a cigar now and
then!--but I take no notice of it. (Calls out.) And my smoking-cap too,
Morten. Katherine, you can tell him where I left it. Ah, he has got it.
(The boys bring the various things.) Now, my friends. I stick to my
pipe, you know. This one has seen plenty of bad weather with me up
north. (Touches glasses with them.) Your good health! Ah, it is good to
be sitting snug and warm here.
[B returns Mr. Sniffles to the knapsack.] You're off the hook this time, fuzzy boy. Let's start clearing away some of this dirt and these rocks.

They're going to put a bush across the road, and when
the friar gets down to pull it out of the way they'll snap what they can
off the ass, and away with them.
[Hands from the other side start clearing away dirt and rocks.] Thank goodness. Now I don't have to die next to you, you big dweeb.
<===>
[jumping down from the garden to the lawn and running to
Hector's left hand] I hope you'll shake hands with me before you go,
Hector. I admire and respect you more than I can say. [He is affected
almost to tears as they shake hands].
