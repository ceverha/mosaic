A:
	Let me get this straight. You did what?

B:
	I built a fully-functioning time machine that can take us to any place AT any time in the whole history of the earth! So, where do you want to go, and WHEN?

A:
	Who was it that pulled at me? Who brought me back?

B:
	Well, that was me, of course. I figured you might be getting a bit bored back in the 19th century. Don't you want to explore?

A:
	I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.

B:
	All right. I'll explain. I'm your great-great-great-great-great-great grandson. I built this time machine here. I popped back to the 1800s, found you, and pulled you back--or forward?--into the 21st century. And now I want to spend some quality time with you. I can take you back to your time whenever you like.

A:
	I didn't do--anything.

B:
	Not yet, silly! But now you can do anything you want. Anything in the world. So, what do you say? You want to go on an adventure?

A:
	Get out! GET OUT!

B:
	I'm-- I'm sorry. I didn't think you'd react this way. Do you want me to take you back now?

A:
	That is hypocrisy! At times when I have needed it, the very
last thing you have thought of has been to give me any help!

B:
	I could hardly be expected to have visited you earlier in your life, guided you along the way... Look, I know you've endured hardship, but--

A:
	I don't care. Don't speak to me again.

B:
	But--

A:
	Now, unfortunately, he has a clerk. I am sorry.

B:
	No, I'M sorry. More than you can know.
