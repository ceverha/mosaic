A:
	How are you doing today? I haven't seen you in a while.

B:
	Today's a bit better, but yesterday was awful.

A:
	[_Leaving the room by way of the passage to the left._] There's nothing
inexpensive except death.

B:
	[stopping A's way] That's easy for you to say. You didn't lose her. I did.

A:
	Really? Now that's hard to believe. 

B:
	Are you calling me a liar?

A:
	Yes.

B:
	You heartless bastard! I LOST MY MOTHER! Why else would I come to YOU for help?

A:
	It's all about finding the balance.

B:
	But how can I do that when everything feels so unstable?

A:
	Why not? She won't eat you.

B:
	Ha! No, not while the worms are eating her.

A:
	That is surprising - I never thought about it like that before.

B:
	To be fair, I didn't come up with that. It's Shakespeare. Hamlet, I think.

A:
	It might make you one of us, there's no doubt about
that. It's the only thing that would do it.

B:
	I'm not in a rush to join you. First, I lost you. Then, before I knew it, mom was gone. I honestly never thought I'd hear your voice again.
