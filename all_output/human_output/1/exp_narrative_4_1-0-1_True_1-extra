I built a fully-functioning time machine that can take us to any place AT any time in the whole history of the earth! So, where do you want to go, and WHEN?

It is best for me to go see the smith myself and leave it to no other
one. You can be attending to that ass-car out in the yard wants a new
tyre in the wheelâ€”out in the rear of the yard it is. [_They go to
door._] To pay attention to every small thing, and to fill up every
minute of time shaping whatever you have to do, that is the way to
build up a business.
All right. I'll explain. I'm your great-great-great-great-great-great grandson. I built this time machine here. I popped back to the 1800s, found you, and pulled you back--or forward?--into the 21st century. And now I want to spend some quality time with you. I can take you back to your time whenever you like.

You'll be going away yourself before long.
(Eileen _shakes her head. He goes on without noticing, wrapped in his
own success._) Oh, Eileen, you can't imagine all it opens up for
me--selling that story. I don't have to go back home to stagnate. I can
go straight to New York, and live, and meet real people who are doing
things. I can take my time, and try and do the work I hope to.
(_Feelingly._) You don't know how grateful I am to you, Eileen--how
you've helped me. Oh, I don't mean just the typing, I mean your
encouragement, your faith! I'd never have had guts enough to stick to
it myself. The stories would never have been written if it hadn't been
for you.
I'm-- I'm sorry. I didn't think you'd react this way. Do you want me to take you back now?
<===>
Haven't you me? Do you think I would leave you in the lurch?
But--
<===>
But now?
