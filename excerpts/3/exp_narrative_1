A:
	We are lost in this cave. How much more battery power do we have left?

B:
	And you have no right to; no right to despise me! Lona, you
can have no idea how utterly alone I stand in this cramped and stunted
community--where I have had, year after year, to stifle my ambition for
a fuller life. My work may seem many-sided, but what have I really
accomplished? Odds and ends--scraps. They would not stand anything else
here. If I were to go a step in advance of the opinions and views that
are current at the moment, I should lose all my influence. Do you know
what we are--we who are looked upon as pillars of society? We are
nothing more, nor less, than the tools of society.

A:
	Why have you only begun to realise that now?

B:
	Because I have been thinking a great deal lately--since you
came back--and this evening I have thought more seriously than ever
before. Oh, Lona, why did not I really know you then--in the old days,
I mean?

A:
	And if you had?

B:
	I should never have let you go; and, if I had had you, I
should not be in the position I am in tonight.

A:
	And do you never consider what she might have been to you--she
whom you chose in my place?

B:
	I know, at all events, that she has been nothing to me of what
I needed.

A:
	Because you have never shared your interests with her; because
you have never allowed her full and frank exchange of thoughts with
you; because you have allowed her to be borne under by self-reproach
for the shame you cast upon one who was dear to her.

B:
	Yes, yes; it all comes from lying and deceit.

A:
	Then why not break with all this lying and deceit?

B:
	Now? It is too late now, Lona.

A:
	Karsten, tell me--what gratification does all this show and
deception bring you?

B:
	It brings me none. I must disappear someday, and all this
community of bunglers with me. But a generation is growing up that will
follow us; it is my son that I work for--I am providing a career for
him. There will come a time when truth will enter into the life of the
community, and on that foundation he shall build up a happier existence
than his father.

A:
	With a lie at the bottom of it all? Consider what sort of an
inheritance it is that you are leaving to your son.

B:
	It is a thousand times worse
than you think. But surely some day the curse must be lifted; and
yet--nevertheless--. (Vehemently.) How could I bring all this upon my
own head! Still, it is done now; I must go on with it now. You shall
not succeed in crushing me! (HILMAR comes in hurriedly and agitatedly
from the right, with an open letter in his hand.)
