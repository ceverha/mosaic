A:
	Let me get this straight. You did what?

B:
	Yes, you see how much I need it. You must coach me up to the last
minute. Promise me that, Torvald!

A:
	You can depend on me.

B:
	You must not think of anything but me, either today or tomorrow;
you mustn't open a single letter--not even open the letter-box--

A:
	Ah, you are still afraid of that fellow--

B:
	Yes, indeed I am.

A:
	Nora, I can tell from your looks that there is a letter from him
lying there.

B:
	I don't know; I think there is; but you must not read anything
of that kind now. Nothing horrid must come between us until this is all
over.

A:
	You mustn't contradict her.

B:
	The child shall have her way. But
tomorrow night, after you have danced--

A:
	(The MAID appears in the doorway to the
right.)

B:
	Dinner is served, ma'am.

A:
	We will have champagne, Helen.

B:
	Very good, ma'am. [Exit.

A:
	Hullo!--are we going to have a banquet?

B:
	Yes, a champagne banquet until the small hours. (Calls out.) And a
few macaroons, Helen--lots, just for once!
