A:
	Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.

B:
	Well, I thought it should be the young wife of a sailor, who
lies sleeping in strange unrest, and she is dreaming. I fancy I shall do
it so that you will see she is dreaming.

A:
	Is there anything else?

B:
	Yes, there's to be another figure--a sort of apparition, as
they say. It's her husband, to whom she has been faithless while he was
away, and he is drowned at sea.

A:
	What?

B:
	Drowned?

A:
	Yes, he was drowned on a sea voyage. But that's the
wonderful part of it--he comes home all the same. It is night-time. And
he is standing by her bed looking at her. He is to stand there dripping
wet, like one drawn from the sea.

B:
	What an extraordinary idea!
(Shutting her eyes.) Oh! I can see it so clearly, living before me!

A:
	But how on earth, Mr.--Mr.--I thought you said it was to be
something you had experienced.

B:
	I did experience that--that is to say, to a certain
extent.

A:
	You saw a dead man?

B:
	Well, I don't mean I've actually seen this--experienced it
in the flesh. But still--

A:
	Yes, that'll be quite in your line. Something that
has to do with sea fancies.

B:
	What was it, Mr. Lyngstrand?

A:
	Well, it was like this. At the time when we were to sail
home in the brig from a town they called Halifax, we had to leave
the boatswain behind in the hospital. So we had to engage an American
instead. This new boatswain Ellida. The American?

B:
	Yes, one day he got the captain to lend him a lot of old
newspapers and he was always reading them. For he wanted to teach
himself Norwegian, he said.
