A:
	I can't believe you threw that ball over the fence. Now you're going to have to go into that dark, scary, spooky forest all by yourself!

B:
	A spooky forest is the best kind of adventure

A:
	You'd better not. (Marchbanks stops irresolutely.) She'd only
set you to clean my boots, to save me the trouble of doing it myself in
the morning.

B:
	If it were up to you, you'd never clean your boots

A:
	Hurry up! You're making me worried. [hears scream] What was that? Hold on!

B:
	I think it's right about..... here!

A:
	Have you not heard that--? Ahem! (To her daughter) Hilda,
dear, you can go for a little stroll in the garden?

B:
	Hilda, grab me a tomato, I'll come find you in a second!

A:
	It hurts so much, make it stop!

B:
	What? What? Oh my god, here take this

A:
	For I hope you trust me fully?

B:
	Yes, I trust you! Do you trust me? You're bleeding

A:
	Be quiet. 

B:
	Sorry

A:
	It is too late now, I suppose?

B:
	They're coming...... They're here.
