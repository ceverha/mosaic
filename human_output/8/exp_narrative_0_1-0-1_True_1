A:
	Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.

B:
	She doth teach the torches to burn bright.

A:
	Handsome Captain: would you marry me if I hauled down
the flag in the day of battle and burnt the incense? Sons take
after their mothers, you know. Do you want your son to be a
coward?

B:
	If sons take after their mothers, then it doesn't much matter what you do during battle.

A:
	I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.

B:
	That's quite the thing to say. I could be an awful person you know.

A:
	(_slyly_) And you thought, Claire, that the war was lost.

B:
	It seems to me like another battle has just begun.

A:
	You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.

B:
	He provoked me! Believe me love, I would do anything to stay here with you and reverse this doom.

A:
	Because I feel that I am losing you here.

B:
	You are, but not in my heart. I will think of you every minute of every hour.

A:
	With you dead, what keeps me alive?

B:
	The hope that your love can bring me back.

A:
	My poor dear!

B:
	Farewell. One kiss and I'll descend.
