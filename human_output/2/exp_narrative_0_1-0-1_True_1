A:
	Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.

B:
	Ah yes, that is the Elizabeth, the Duchess of York. She's quite the charmer.

A:
	I will certainly not propose anything so dangerous as an
excursion.

B:
	What an excursion with Elizabeth? Even if you dared to propose such an excursion, Elizabeth is far to proper to accept such an offer.

A:
	I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.

B:
	Excuse me, but I thought we were talking about the Duchess. I am but a stranger on the street you met just seconds ago.

A:
	[Looking at him.] Whom?

B:
	Are you feeling alright? Either you are very sick or very peculiar...

A:
	You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.

B:
	Definitely very sick in the mind...

A:
	And youâ€™ve been married five months.

B:
	As if! I am only a 13 year old girl.

A:
	With you dead, what keeps me alive?

B:
	But I'm not dead.

A:
	What did you do to the copper?

B:
	Does copper have anything to do with death?
