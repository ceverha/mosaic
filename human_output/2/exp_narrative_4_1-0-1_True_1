A:
	Let me get this straight. You did what?

B:
	I stole a tomato from the grocery store.

A:
	Is she there now?

B:
	Is who there now?

A:
	I'm so sorry, but we need to address this now. It can't go ignored.

B:
	Who needs to be addressed? I don't understand!

A:
	But you have done that! You know it is you that love me, and
not she. You know it is you that I love, and not her. What more do you
need?

B:
	I thought we were just talking about how I stole a tomato, and now we're talking about love? I need clarity goddammit!

A:
	Get out! GET OUT!

B:
	Fine! I will! I don't like being around you right now anyways!

A:
	Yes; and I'm glad you're free of him, for your own sake. I knew
he wasn't the person. (_With an attempt at a joking tone._) You must
get one of the right sort--next time.

B:
	Well, it is clear that the right sort is not you. (Leaves in a huff).

A:
	I don't care. Don't speak to me again.

B:
	I won't.

A:
	Signe, dear! What does this mean? What is it that I have done?

B:
	Fuck you! You have no right to call me 'dear' any longer.
