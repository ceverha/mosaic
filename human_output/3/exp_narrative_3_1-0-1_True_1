A:
	I can't believe you threw that ball over the fence. Now you're going to have to go into that dark, scary, spooky forest all by yourself!

B:
	Great! I love dark scary places that I can only go into.

A:
	Then have respect for me--and go!

B:
	Alrght. (Starts taking off clothes)

A:
	Hurry up! You're making me worried. [hears scream] What was that? Hold on!

B:
	(Completely naked) What? What is it?

A:
	Do you hear them up there? When that is over, we may expect
them back.

B:
	(Peeing slightly) Fuck! Well we're just fucked aren't we? Let's get out of here.

A:
	It hurts so much, make it stop!

B:
	(Slaps "A" in the face) Stop being a little bitch and get your clothes off already.

A:
	{Goes on slowly without hearing him.} It's a pitiful thing to be
getting old, but it's a queer thing surely. It's a queer thing to see
an old man sitting up there in his bed with no teeth in him, and a rough
word in his mouth, and his chin the way it would take the bark from the
edge of an oak board you'ld have building a door.... God forgive me,
Micheal Dara, we'll all be getting old, but it's a queer thing surely.

B:
	(Snaps "A" neck) Well at least you get to die before that fucking beast comes back.

A:
	Be quiet. 

B:
	I just killed you. How are you still alive?

A:
	[_Softly_.] Are you not mine? Are you not my wife in the eyes of
heaven?

B:
	(_Whispher in ear_) No I not, but I hope you do find her in the place you're going to. (Pulls "A" head right off his shoulders)
