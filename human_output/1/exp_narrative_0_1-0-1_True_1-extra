Oh my god, she looks amazing. She looks like a young Maggie Smith. I'd like to get McGonag-ALL up in that. Should I go talk to her?

 I think my idea of bringing up a young girl has been rather
a success.  Dont you listen to this, Patsy:  it might make you
conceited.  Shes never been treated like a child.  I always said the
same thing to her mother.  Let her read what she likes.  Let her do
what she likes.  Let her go where she likes.  Eh, Patsy?
Mmmm, I like it. Coming on a little strong, maybe, but you've got to make an impact with a girl like that. [A starts to walk toward the smokin' hot superbabe but gets nervous and returns to B.

Why don't you build a comfortable fire and cook a cup of hot coffee.
After rain comes the sunshine. That's the way it is between married
people. There will be storms in every marriage. But after the storm
everything grows greener. The main thing is: Bye, baby, bye--[_He
imitates the gesture of one rocking a child in his arms._]--That's the
right way. That's the thing that you two must get for yourselves.
[_Jovially patting HENSCHEL'S shoulder._] That's what the old man likes.
You two must get together and buy a toy like that. Confound it, Henschel!
It would be queer if that weren't easy. A giant of a man like you! Good
night all.
[B slaps A across the face.] Pull yourself together. You're not talking sense. Now, take a deep breath. [A does.] And go talk to her.

Wanted? (_as if wanting is something that harks far back. But
the word calls to her passion_) Wanted! (_a sob, hands out, she goes to
him. But before his arms can take her, she steps back_) Are you trying
to pull me down into what I wanted? Are you here to make me stop?
Oh my god, then... All our playful misogyny was just some filmy facade designed to hide our deep homoerotic longing for one another? Chad, I can't believe this! You know what this means?
<===>
[_Thrusting him back with outstretched hands_.]  No,
don’t speak!  Say nothing!  Your voice wakes terrible memories—memories
of things that made me love you—memories of words that made me love
you—memories that now are horrible to me.  And how I worshipped you!  You
were to me something apart from common life, a thing pure, noble, honest,
without stain.  The world seemed to me finer because you were in it, and
goodness more real because you lived.  And now—oh, when I think that I
made of a man like you my ideal! the ideal of my life!
