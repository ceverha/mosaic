	We are lost in this cave. How much more battery power do we have left?

	We have exaclty 1.267 hours until our GPS dies.

A:

Good-bye. (He makes boldly for the window, and his hand is on
the shutter when there is a terrible burst of firing in the
street beneath.)

B:
	If you do that we all die.

A:
	How much food do we have left? I'm beginning to worry.

B:
	Approximatley 4.83 pounds of goat meat.

A:
	[_With noisy joviality._] Ha, ha, ha! A vigorous product, I must say!
Eight pounds and ten grams of good healthy, German national flesh!

B:
	Hell yeah brother

A:
	Look! Is that a shaft of light I see?

B:
	No, that's the PCP.

A:
	No, I haven't--I haven't.

B:
	Goodnight sweet prince.

A:
	Hooray! We've escaped!

B:
	That's the PCP again.

A:
	Don't you think everythin' she does right an' fine? D'you ever give her a

B:
	Oh god, how much did you smoke?
