A:
	How are you doing today? I haven't seen you in a while.

B:
	I know it's been awhile, I haven't seen you either. I hate what happened between us.

A:
	The fight is over now, as far as I am concerned.

B:
	I still can't get over what you did to me. I don't feel like my old self anymore.

A:
	Really? Now that's hard to believe. 

B:
	You used me and treated me like a toy.

A:
	Antonin, I was there when you spoke to Julie. You did say
three bottles.

B:
	I know what I said. I was there. It was you that I had the problem with, not Julie.

A:
	It's all about finding the balance.

B:
	Yeah, finding the balance between you and Julie.

A:
	I have never stood farther from my goal than I do now.

B:
	And what's that?

A:
	That is surprising - I never thought about it like that before.

B:
	Thank you, next.

A:
	[_Sees_ MRS. ARBUTHNOTâ€™S _letter on table_, _and takes
it up and looks at envelope_.]  What a curious handwriting!  It reminds
me of the handwriting of a woman I used to know years ago.

B:
	Yeah it was Julie's wasn't it?
