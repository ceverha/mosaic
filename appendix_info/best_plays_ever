A:	I can't believe you threw that ball over the fence. Now you're going to have to go into that dark, scary, spooky forest all by yourself!

B:	[Violently.] Well, living with you is enough to drive anyone off
their nut. Your bunk about the farm being so fine! Didn't I write you
year after year how rotten it was and what a dirty slave them cousins
made of me? What'd you care? Nothing! Not even enough to come out and
see me! That crazy bull about wanting to keep me away from the sea
don't go down with me! You yust didn't want to be bothered with me!
You're like all the rest of 'em!

A:	[Feebly.] Anna! It ain't so--

B:	[Not heeding his interruption--revengefully.] But one thing I
never wrote you. It was one of them cousins that you think is such nice
people--the youngest son--Paul--that started me wrong. [Loudly.] It
wasn't none of my fault. I hated him worse 'n hell and he knew it. But
he was big and strong--[Pointing to Burke]--like you!

A:	[Half springing to his feet--his fists clenched,] God blarst it!
[He sinks slowly back in his chair again, the knuckles showing white on
his clenched hands, his face tense with the effort to suppress his
grief and rage.]

B:	[In a cry of horrified pain.] Anna!

A:	[To him--seeming not to have heard their interruptions.] That was
why I run away from the farm. That was what made me get a yob as nurse
girl in St. Paul. [With a hard, mocking laugh.] And you think that was
a nice yob for a girl, too, don't you? [Sarcastically.] With all them
nice inland fellers yust looking for a chance to marry me, I s'pose.
Marry me? What a chance! They wasn't looking for marrying. [As BURKE
lets a groan of fury escape him--desperately.] I'm owning up to
everything fair and square. I was caged in, I tell you--yust like in
yail--taking care of other people's kids--listening to 'em bawling and
crying day and night--when I wanted to be out--and I was
lonesome--lonesome as hell! [With a sudden weariness in her voice.] So
I give up finally. What was the use? [She stops and looks at the two
men. Both are motionless and silent. CHRIS seems in a stupor of
despair, his house of cards fallen about him. BURKE's face is livid
with the rage that is eating him up, but he is too stunned and
bewildered yet to find a vent for it. The condemnation she feels in
their silence goads ANNA into a harsh, strident defiance.] You don't
say nothing--either of you--but I know what you're thinking. You're
like all the rest! [To CHRIS--furiously.] And who's to blame for it, me
or you? If you'd even acted like a man--if you'd even been a regular
father and had me with you--maybe things would be different!

B:	[In agony.] Don't talk dat vay, Anna! Ay go crazy! Ay von't
listen! [Puts his hands over his ears.]

A:	[Infuriated by his action--stridently.] You will too listen! [She
leans over and pulls his hands from his ears--with hysterical rage.]
You--keeping me safe inland--I wasn't no nurse girl the last two
years--I lied when I wrote you--I was in a house, that's what!--yes,
that kind of a house--the kind sailors like you and Mat goes to in
port--and your nice inland men, too--and all men, God damn 'em! I hate
'em! Hate 'em! [She breaks into hysterical sobbing, throwing herself
into the chair and hiding her face in her hands on the table. The two
men have sprung to their feet.]

B:	[Whimpering like a child.] Anna! Anna! It's lie! It's lie! [He
stands wringing his hands together and begins to weep.]

A:	[His whole great body tense like a spring--dully and gropingly.]
So that's what's in it!

B:	[Raising her head at the sound of his voice--with extreme mocking
bitterness.] I s'pose you remember your promise, Mat? No other reason
was to count with you so long as I wasn't married already. So I s'pose
you want me to get dressed and go ashore, don't you? [She laughs.] Yes,
you do!

A:	[On the verge of his outbreak--stammeringly.] God stiffen you!

B:	[Trying to keep up her hard, bitter tone, but gradually letting a
note of pitiful pleading creep in.] I s'pose if I tried to tell you I
wasn't--that--no more you'd believe me, wouldn't you? Yes, you would!
And if I told you that yust getting out in this barge, and being on the
sea had changed me and made me feel different about things,'s if all
I'd been through wasn't me and didn't count and was yust like it never
happened--you'd laugh, wouldn't you? And you'd die laughing sure if I
said that meeting you that funny way that night in the fog, and
afterwards seeing that you was straight goods stuck on me, had got me
to thinking for the first time, and I sized you up as a different kind
of man--a sea man as different from the ones on land as water is from
mud--and that was why I got stuck on you, too. I wanted to marry you
and fool you, but I couldn't. Don't you see how I'd changed? I couldn't
marry you with you believing a lie--and I was shamed to tell you the
truth--till the both of you forced my hand, and I seen you was the same
as all the rest. And now, give me a bawling out and beat it, like I can
tell you're going to. [She stops, looking at BURKE. He is silent, his
face averted, his features beginning to work with fury. She pleads
passionately.] Will you believe it if I tell you that loving you has
made me--clean? It's the straight goods, honest! [Then as he doesn't
reply--bitterly.] Like hell you will! You're like all the rest!

A:	[Blazing out--turning on her in a perfect frenzy of rage--his
voice trembling with passion.] The rest, is it? God's curse on you!
Clane, is it? You slut, you, I'll be killing you now! [He picks up the
chair on which he has been sitting and, swinging it high over his
shoulder, springs toward her. CHRIS rushes forward with a cry of alarm,
trying to ward off the blow from his daughter. ANNA looks up into
BURKE'S eyes with the fearlessness of despair. BURKE checks himself,
the chair held in the air.]

B:	[Wildly.] Stop, you crazy fool! You vant for murder her!

A:	Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.

B:	Well, I thought it should be the young wife of a sailor, who
lies sleeping in strange unrest, and she is dreaming. I fancy I shall do
it so that you will see she is dreaming.

A:	Is there anything else?

B:	Yes, there's to be another figure--a sort of apparition, as
they say. It's her husband, to whom she has been faithless while he was
away, and he is drowned at sea.

A:	What?

B:	Drowned?

A:	Yes, he was drowned on a sea voyage. But that's the
wonderful part of it--he comes home all the same. It is night-time. And
he is standing by her bed looking at her. He is to stand there dripping
wet, like one drawn from the sea.

B:	What an extraordinary idea!
(Shutting her eyes.) Oh! I can see it so clearly, living before me!

A:	But how on earth, Mr.--Mr.--I thought you said it was to be
something you had experienced.

B:	I did experience that--that is to say, to a certain
extent.

A:	You saw a dead man?

B:	Well, I don't mean I've actually seen this--experienced it
in the flesh. But still--

A:	Yes, that'll be quite in your line. Something that
has to do with sea fancies.

B:	What was it, Mr. Lyngstrand?

A:	Well, it was like this. At the time when we were to sail
home in the brig from a town they called Halifax, we had to leave
the boatswain behind in the hospital. So we had to engage an American
instead. This new boatswain Ellida. The American?

B:	Yes, one day he got the captain to lend him a lot of old
newspapers and he was always reading them. For he wanted to teach
himself Norwegian, he said.

A:	How are you doing today? I haven't seen you in a while.

B:	Ooowie, let me tell you. I've had quite the week. Just yesterday, I ran into Katherine and she had me run all around town to pick up stuff for her cousin's birthday party. Balloons, cakes, clowns...I'm talkin the whole shebang! Barely left me any time to tend to my shoe shining business

A:	Be quick. If you are away five minutes, it will seem
five hours. (Raina runs to the top of the steps and turns there
to exchange a look with him and wave him a kiss with both hands.
He looks after her with emotion for a moment, then turns slowly
away, his face radiant with the exultation of the scene which
has just passed. The movement shifts his field of vision, into
the corner of which there now comes the tail of Louka's double
apron. His eye gleams at once. He takes a stealthy look at her,
and begins to twirl his moustache nervously, with his left hand
akimbo on his hip. Finally, striking the ground with his heels
in something of a cavalry swagger, he strolls over to the left
of the table, opposite her, and says) Louka: do you know what
the higher love is?

B:	Well sweetie, I can only imagine what you want me to say. Sure, I may drone on for a while about love and romanance and destiny, and I'm sure you'd have a witty response back to me. But at the end of the day, nothing stands in between me and my shoe shining business...and that's that!

A:	Really? Now that's hard to believe. 

B:	Yeah, I guess you're right. You've always been a real charmer. Maybe I could fall for one of your games one more time...(blinks seductively)

A:	Well, if it were really agony, would you ask for more of it?

B:	There he goes with his witty quips! You always know how to charm me. Alright, let me close up the shop and we can go grab a drink?

A:	It's all about finding the balance.

B:	The only balance I'll be seeing today is negative...I was barely open for 3 hours today! 2 customers and they barely tipped me a dime. Let's go.

A:	Some one would need to go to Berlin an' tell the King how hard put to it
we are.

B:	No kidding. My son is all upset because I expect him to spend his summer at the shop instead of frolicking in France like a fa...oh sorry, I almost got carried away. Yeah, damn the King!

A:	If you mean that you will be a treasure to him, he thinks
so now; and you can keep him thinking so if you like.

B:	Help! help! They are killing Charles. Help!

A:	Get out! GET OUT!

B:	And I have sworn that I won't slacken in his service until I've
drawn my last breath!

A:	[Goes up behind him and lays her hands on his shoulders.]
Oswald, my dear boy--has it shaken you very much?

B:	Then come, come!  The horses are waiting below on the
hill.

A:	I don't care. Don't speak to me again.

B:	Thank you.

A:	Certainly.

B:	Never fear, sir. We know how to respict a brave innimy.

A:	I can't believe you threw that ball over the fence. Now you're going to have to go into that dark, scary, spooky forest all by yourself!

B:	[Decidedly, turning to IRENE.] Shall we meet up there then?

A:	What do you mean?

B:	I thought I heard the noise I used to hear when my friends came to
visit me.

A:	Hurry up! You're making me worried. [hears scream] What was that? Hold on!

B:	and Madame Mairaut, monsieur. They wish to speak to you.

A:	Prithee, Rabbi.

B:	Yes, yes.

A:	It hurts so much, make it stop!

B:	[Lively again, looks at him.] Perhaps you have even forgotten what day
it was?

A:	Then I'll sit here until I get the money. [_He sits down._] You
will pay day after to-morrow? Excellent! Here I stay until day after
to-morrow. [_Jumps up._] I ask you, do I have to pay that interest
to-morrow or not? Or do you think I'm joking?

B:	Yes, you are; you must be. And in what state of mind has he
returned to you? Bethink yourself well, Mrs. Alving. You sinned greatly
against your husband;--that you recognise by raising yonder memorial to
him. Recognise now, also, how you have sinned against your son--there
may yet be time to lead him back from the paths of error. Turn back
yourself, and save what may yet be saved in him. For [With uplifted
forefinger] verily, Mrs. Alving, you are a guilt-laden mother! This I
have thought it my duty to say to you.

A:	Be quiet. 

B:	I swear it, Salomé.

A:	[_Looking up._] The crows are my darlings! I like
their harsh merriment better than those sad cries of the wind and the
rushes. Look at them, they are tossing about like witches, tossing about
on the wind, drunk with the wind.

B:	Well, then the passengers jump out and move about a little, Mrs. Hedda.

A:	Who is that beautiful woman over there? I have never seen something so exquisite.

B:	[Who has regained his composure--sheepishly.] Py golly, dat
scare me for minute. It's only some fallar hail, Anna--loose his course
in fog. Must be fisherman's power boat. His engine break down, Ay
guess. [The "ahoy" comes again through the wall of fog, sounding much
nearer this time. CHRIS goes over to the port bulwark.] Sound from dis
side. She come in from open sea. [He holds his hands to his mouth,
megaphone-fashion, and shouts back.] Ahoy, dere! Vhat's trouble?

A:	In the grave you think it is pleasant to lie?

B:	[Stares at her in astonishment.] Not ours? Why, what can you
mean by that?

A:	I know I just met you, but I love you with all my heart.

B:	That is where I always stand--on everyday occasions.

A:	Oh, no, no. A scientific man, perhaps, like yourself. But
you know what I mean--a MAN. (Strikes himself a sounding blow on the
chest.)

B:	What do you mean?

A:	You killed my cousin? And now I can never see you again? I cannot live any more.

B:	It's for want of a new picker, sir.

A:	No. Ive something to tell you. Sit down and lets be
comfortable.

B:	A member of His Majesty's Government that everybody sets down as
a nincompoop: don't forget him, Lady Utterword.

A:	With you dead, what keeps me alive?

B:	And chiefly among the younger artists?

A:	There are mysterious rumors in the air.
A vestal recently was led to death--

B:	It is Cuchulain who is trembling. It is Cuchulain who is shaking the

A:	We are lost in this cave. How much more battery power do we have left?

B:	Enough, enough: Caesar has spoiled me for talking to weak
things like you. (She goes out. Pothinus, with a gesture of rage, is
following, when Ftatateeta enters and stops him.)

A:	Yes, money and gunpowder; freedom and power; command
of life and command of death.

B:	Yes, you understand the way to get on; that your worst enemy must allow.
Before the weaver has taken to bed, you're gettin' his coffin ready.

A:	How much food do we have left? I'm beginning to worry.

B:	And if I asked you now for a--? No!

A:	I know. You feel that you could love anybody that offered--

B:	Well, dear, there were other differences. I
really cannot bear an immoral man. I am not a Pharisee, I hope;
and I should not have minded his merely doing wrong things: we
are none of us perfect. But your father didn't exactly do wrong
things: he said them and thought them: that was what was so
dreadful. He really had a sort of religion of wrongness just as
one doesn't mind men practising immorality so long as they own
that they are in the wrong by preaching morality; so I couldn't
forgive Andrew for preaching immorality while he practised
morality. You would all have grown up without principles, without
any knowledge of right and wrong, if he had been in the house.
You know, my dear, your father was a very attractive man in some
ways. Children did not dislike him; and he took advantage of it
to put the wickedest ideas into their heads, and make them quite
unmanageable. I did not dislike him myself: very far from it; but
nothing can bridge over moral disagreement.

A:	Look! Is that a shaft of light I see?

B:	Gentlemen, my daughter. [They all bow]. We are very greatly
indebted to you, gentlemen, for so kindly indulging her whim. [The
dressing bell sounds. The Count looks at his watch]. Ah! The dressing
bell, gentlemen. As our play begins at nine, I have had to put forward
the dinner hour a little. May I shew you to your rooms? [He goes out,
followed by all the men, except Trotter, who, going last, is detained by
Fanny].

A:	rU see her on board.

B:	Man always falls into a trap, when his instinct leads him; but let us
veil his reason, let us change his character; we shall behold a sight
that will make us smile....

A:	Hooray! We've escaped!

B:	It’s no use, he won’t see us.

A:	Am I dismissed now, your honour?

B:	Kristin, you are a woman,--and my friend. Beware of this wretch.
